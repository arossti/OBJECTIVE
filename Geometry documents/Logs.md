 [PurePhi] Icosahedron - High-precision symbolic construction:
   φ = (1 + 1√5)/2 = 1.618033988749895
   φ² = (3 + 1√5)/2 = 2.618033988749895 (identity: φ + 1)
   1 + φ² = (5 + 1√5)/2 = 3.618033988749895
   Normalization: 1/√(1 + φ²) = 0.525731112119134
   a = 1·norm = 0.021029244484765
   b = φ·norm = 0.034026032334082
   Precision: 15 decimal places maintained via symbolic algebra
   Identity check: |φ² - (φ + 1)| = 0e+0 (should be ~0)
