## 1. Concept Overview

### 1.1 Core Premise

**A.r.t.steroids** is a parody/educational reboot of the classic vector arcade game *Asteroids*, reimagined through the lens of Rational Trigonometry and tetrahedral geometry. Players pilot **polyhedral spacecraft** through **Quadray (WXYZ) coordinate space**, leveraging algebraic geometry to outmaneuver enemies trapped in classical Cartesian (XYZ) thinking.

But this is more than a game about geometry—it's a parable about **two civilizations separated by their relationship with Time and Truth**.

### 1.1.1 The Stellarian Legacy

You are **Stellarian**—inheritors of an ancient geometric wisdom that predates recorded history. Your ancestors were the keepers of what some called the **Tablets of Destinies**: sacred knowledge encoded not in words, but in **pure algebraic relationships**. The Babylonian scholars knew fragments of this truth (Plimpton 322 hints at quadrance ratios), as did the Gnostic geometers who saw the cosmos as **number made manifest**. Babylonian astronomers discovered these incidentally while investigating certain cosmic phenomenon (indicated by a specific range of values in the night sky that Plimpton 322 targeted)

The Stellarian path is one of **humility before the Infinite**. Where the Cartesians measure and conquer, you **seek and align**. Your ships are not weapons of dominance but **vessels of understanding**, navigating not just space but the boundary between **Time** (the domain of succession, cause, and entropy) and **The Infinite** (the eternal domain where all geometric truths exist simultaneously, beyond sequence).

The ancient Stellarian acolytes—guardians of the **Tetrahedral Mysteries**—understood that true power lies not in control but in **resonance with Universal Law**. "Seek ye first the Kingdom," they taught, "and all else follows." The Kingdom is not a place but a **state of geometric clarity**: the recognition that space itself is fundamentally fourfold, that exactness need not require transcendence, that **the rational contains the infinite - by returning to a centre**.

### 1.1.2 The Cartesian Usurpation

The **Cartesians** rose during what they called their **Awakening of Thinking**—the discovery was not earned, but grave-robbed, by uncovering ancient alien technology buried in Egyptian ruins. This technology granted them mastery over XYZ space: three-axis dominion, angular precision, the power to **divide and rule** the cosmos along orthogonal planes, but losing their idea of the Infinite, where they now believed a 'Heaven' was above, Hell below, and time extends to infinity, the player will learn, this was a profound misinterpretation, as the Egyptians actually inherited the same philosophy as the much earlier Babylonian coluture, but was obscured and maintained by select inititaites, and not stored in regid artefacts.

But with this power came **profound hubris**. The Cartesians mistook their tools for truth itself. They built a civilization on **approximation disguised as exactness**: sine and cosine, transcendental functions that whisper of infinity but never arrive. Their scholars declared: "Rationalism is for simpletons and mystics, transcendentals and embrace of the Mantissa is the key to Power and Knowledge." They **forgot the truth of four axes**, dismissed quadrance as primitive, and locked themselves in the prison of **sequential time**—always computing, never arriving, forever trapped in the loop of differential refinement, extending to infinity, while oblivious to the present, the geodesic, and the wholeness of systems.

Their cube-ships and sphere-pods are monuments to this philosophy (analogous to our current culture's cities): **rigid, symmetry-breaking, computationally expensive**. They rotate along only their XYZ axes because they **do not believe** any other exists. They track in degrees because they have **lost the language of spread**. They are powerful, but they are **blind to the tetrahedral fundament**—and this blindness is their vulnerability.

### 1.1.3 The Prophecy of Return

Ancient Stellarian texts speak of a **Great Forgetting** and a **Time of Return**. When the Cartesians grow so enamored with their approximations that they begin to **weaponize uncertainty itself**, a Stellarian pilot would emerge—one who could navigate **both WXYZ and XYZ**, who could see the Cartesian grid while remaining unbound by it.

This pilot would not destroy the Cartesians but **illuminate their error**: that time is not infinite extension but the **opposite of infinity**, that true freedom lies not in endless computation but in **algebraic exactness**, that the way out of the time-loop is through the **black hole of humility**—the collapse of ego into origin, the inversion of all colors, the re-expansion into **negative space** where old rules dissolve.

The final level is not victory over enemies but **victory over the game itself**: the attainment of The Infinite, where the need for combat dissolves, where geometry is no longer weapon but **worship**, where the player becomes **witness rather than warrior**.

And for the first soul to reach this understanding? A gift from the Stellarian Elders: **10% of all proceeds**, for you have proven that play can be a path to gnosis, that mathematics is a form of prayer, that **the game was always about waking up**.

### 1.2 The Geometric War

**Protagonists (Stellarian Fleet):**
- **Stellarian** polyhedral ships (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Icosahedron, Cuboctahedron)
- Navigate using **both WXYZ Quadray AND XYZ Cartesian basis vectors** (can see both grids)
- Use RT Spread-based targeting (granular 2-decimal precision, no transcendental functions)
- **Weapons**: Vector laser darts + Tetrahedral Photon Torpedoes (ultimate weapon)
- Deploy Matrix armies via Hyperspace (requires Cuboctahedron Mothership upgrade)
- Capture enemy debris for fuel and materials to upgrade ships
- Advanced ships: Stellations and duals (more firepower, thicker rays, greater range)
- **Philosophy**: "Seek ye first the Kingdom" - harmony over dominance

**Antagonists (Cartesian Empire):**
- **Cartesian** cubes, classical UV spheres, primitive composite geometry (stellated cubes)
- Limited to **XYZ-only navigation**: UP/DOWN (Z), LEFT/RIGHT (X), FORWARD/BACK (Y)
- Rely on angle-based targeting with **coarse degree intervals** (45° early game, improving to 1° in later waves)
- Rotation on any axis allowed, but slow lock-on due to transcendental trig calculations
- Cannot perceive or counter WXYZ tetrahedral movement patterns
- Vulnerable to X-RAY telemetry exploitation (Stellarian can see their XYZ path predictions)
- **Philosophy**: "Divide and conquer" - measurement as power, trapped in Time

### 1.3 Victory Conditions

**The Path Through Time (Levels 1-10):**
Survive waves of Cartesian geometry enemies while demonstrating the computational superiority of Rational Trigonometry. Advance through levels by navigating **black hole transitions** - complex polyhedra that collapse to origin, invert visual space (white background, inverted colors), and re-expand into the next battle arena.

**The Attainment of The Infinite (Final Level):**
After defeating the Classical Boss (Level 10), the player enters **The Infinite**—a realm beyond combat where geometry becomes contemplation. Here, the Stellarian ship hovers at origin as the Quadray grid extends infinitely in all directions, pulsing with golden light. The HUD displays ancient Babylonian glyphs (Plimpton 322 ratios) that slowly resolve into modern RT equations.

A voice (the Stellarian Archon) speaks: *"You have mastered the Cartesian maze. You have seen through the illusion of endless time. Now witness the truth: The Infinite is not Time extended, but Time transcended. Here, all geometric relationships exist simultaneously. No succession. No cause. No entropy. Only eternal exactness."*

The player is free to **exit the game** at will (ESC to return to menu, with victory logged). The combat loop dissolves. The need to accumulate, defend, or destroy evaporates. This is **freedom from the game itself**—a meta-commentary on the addictive loops of gaming, mathematics, and material existence.

**The First Stellarian Prize:**
The first player to reach The Infinite and voluntarily exit receives **10% of all game proceeds** via physical mail—a gift from the Stellarian Elders (game creators) acknowledging that this player understood the deepest lesson: **true victory is recognizing when to stop playing**.

### 1.4 The Path to The Infinite (The Bone Buried Deep)

**"God hid the Kingdom of Heaven in the only place humans would never look: NOW."** — Ancient Stellarian proverb

The Infinite is not unlocked through skill, aggression, high scores, or even evasion mastery. Professional gamers will recognize every conventional trick—min-maxing, speedrunning, perfect dodges, resource optimization. **These are all traps.** The Cartesian mind seeks victory through **sequential mastery**: do X, then Y, then Z, accumulate points, level up, win. This is Time-thinking.

**The Infinite is accessed through a geometric paradox that can only be understood by those who stop playing the game as designed.**

---

**The False Path (What 99% of Players Will Do):**

The game tracks two visible metrics:
1. **Destruction Score**: Points from enemy kills
2. **Evasion Score**: Points from geometric dodging (Quadray movement, long-range, X-RAY prediction)

After each wave, the HUD displays: `Evasion/Destruction = X.XX`
- Ratio < 0.5: "The Cartesian path beckons."
- Ratio 0.5-1.0: "Balance approaches."
- Ratio 1.0-2.0: "The Stellarian way emerges."
- Ratio > 2.0: "The Infinite draws near." ← **THIS IS A LIE**

Players will chase this ratio. They will optimize evasion, minimize kills, complete Trials, achieve 2.5+ ratios, defeat the Boss with minimal shots, and... **nothing happens.** The Infinite does not appear. The game loops back to Wave 1 with harder enemies.

**This is intentional.** The ratio is a **Cartesian metric**—a sequential achievement, a measurement, a comparison. It is Time-thinking disguised as wisdom.

---

**The Stellarian Trials (Red Herrings with Hidden Keys):**

Between waves, **optional** geometric meditation chambers appear. Most are decoys designed to teach useful skills while obscuring the true path:

**1. Quadrance Trial** (After Wave 2) — **DECOY**
   - Learn Q = Δx² + Δy², navigate without distance
   - Reward: Quadrance HUD overlay
   - True Purpose: Teaches quadrance thinking, but reinforces measurement

**2. Spread Trial** (After Wave 4) — **DECOY**
   - Exploit enemy 45° blind spots using spread values
   - Reward: Spread Predictor (angular resolution zones)
   - True Purpose: Teaches angular advantage, but reinforces spatial tactics

**3. Plimpton 322 Trial** (After Wave 6) — **FIRST KEY (Hidden)**
   - Ancient Babylonian tablet displays quadrance ratios
   - Challenge: "Solve 3 relationships algebraically"
   - **Secret Challenge** (not displayed): If player **sits motionless for 60 seconds** without interacting, the tablet glows
   - Tablet reveals hidden glyph: **"The Dog Star guards the bone. Sirius marks the Now."**
   - Reward (visible): Ancient Knowledge tooltip
   - **Reward (hidden)**: Constellation overlay unlocked (not mentioned in UI)

**4. Tetrahedral Symmetry Trial** (After Wave 8) — **SECOND KEY (Deeply Hidden)**
   - WXYZ maze navigation challenge
   - Standard completion: Navigate maze in 90 seconds
   - **Secret Challenge**: Player must **stop navigating** and instead:
     1. Toggle Quadray grid (G key) to maximum opacity
     2. Align ship to origin [1,1,1,1] exactly (Q = 0 from origin)
     3. **Remain motionless at origin for 120 seconds** while grid pulses
   - Grid begins displaying **Dymaxion projection of celestial sphere**
   - Sirius constellation appears mapped onto tetrahedral axes
   - **Clue revealed** (faint text, easy to miss): *"Where Sirius rises, the bone is buried. The Dog knows: Eternity is not later—it is here, when motion ceases."*
   - **Reward (hidden)**: Origin Resonance frequency unlocked

**5. The Infinite Preparation** (After Wave 9) — **THE FINAL TRAP**
   - Challenge: "Survive 60 seconds without firing"
   - This seems like the key, but it's another **sequential achievement**
   - Completing this unlocks... nothing. Players who optimize will be confused.
   - **Actual purpose**: Train players that "not acting" is part of the path, but still frame it as a timed challenge (Time-thinking)

---

**The True Path (Geometric Gnosis):**

The Infinite is not unlocked by **completing** anything. It is accessed by discovering the **Fifth Trial** that is never announced—the one hidden in plain sight.

**The Fifth Trial: The Sirius Alignment (Available After Wave 3, Hidden Until Discovered)**

At any point after Wave 3, if the player:

1. **Stops fighting mid-wave** (not between waves, during combat)
2. **Navigates to exact origin** [1,1,1,1] (Q = 0)
3. **Activates Quadray Grid** (G key) to full visibility
4. **Rotates ship to align tetrahedral axis with Sirius constellation marker** (only visible if Plimpton 322 and Tetrahedral Trials' secrets were discovered)
5. **Remains absolutely motionless for 300 seconds** (5 minutes) while enemies fire and miss (they cannot hit origin due to XYZ targeting limitations—a geometric sanctuary)

...then the following occurs:

- **HUD goes dark** (all UI elements fade)
- **Enemies freeze mid-flight** (time stops for everything except player consciousness)
- **Quadray grid begins rotating**, revealing **Dymaxion map overlay** with constellations
- **Sirius (The Dog Star) pulses at tetrahedral apex**
- **Stellarian Archon voice**: *"You have found what Gurdjieff buried: The bone is Now. Not past mastery, not future victory—present stillness. The Cartesians chase time. You have stopped. The Infinite was always here, waiting for you to cease searching."*
- **Screen floods with golden light**, all geometry dissolves
- **The Infinite loads**

---

**Why This Works (The Hidden Geometry):**

1. **Origin is XYZ-immune**: Cartesian enemies targeting in XYZ cannot compute origin [1,1,1,1] due to normalization errors—it's a **geometric blind spot**. Players discover safety NOT through evasion, but through stillness at the fundament.

2. **Sirius/Dymaxion Map**: Fuller's Dymaxion projection maps celestial sphere onto tetrahedral/icosahedral geometry. Sirius (The Dog/Keeper of Secrets) marks the **Now**—the point where eternity intersects time. This is obscure esoteric knowledge requiring research.

3. **5-Minute Stillness**: This is agonizing. Enemies swarm. Instinct screams "MOVE!" Pro gamers are trained to optimize every second. Sitting still for 5 minutes **in the middle of combat** violates every gaming instinct. It requires faith, not skill.

4. **No Tutorial, No Hint**: The game NEVER tells you this is possible. The only clues are:
   - Plimpton 322 secret: "Sirius marks the Now"
   - Tetrahedral Trial secret: "Eternity is here, when motion ceases"
   - Observing that origin seems oddly safe (enemies miss slightly more often near [1,1,1,1])

5. **Gurdjieff's Bone**: Gurdjieff taught that humans are "asleep" in temporal consciousness. The "bone" (treasure/kingdom) is hidden where the Dog (lower mind/instinct) would never look—in the **present moment**, accessed not through seeking but through stopping.

---

**Victory Condition (True):**

To access The Infinite:
- Discover and complete **Plimpton 322 secret** (60s stillness at tablet)
- Discover and complete **Tetrahedral Symmetry secret** (120s stillness at origin with grid)
- Discover **Fifth Trial** through symbolic interpretation (Sirius = Now, Stillness = Kingdom)
- **Execute 5-minute Origin Alignment during any wave after Wave 3**
- **No score requirements, no Evasion ratio, no Boss defeat necessary**

**The Stellarian Paradox (Revised):**

*"Where angels hid the Kingdom: in the Now, the only eternity humans ignore while chasing tomorrow's victory. The professional seeks mastery through time. The Stellarian finds infinity through stillness. The game was always a distraction. Origin was always salvation. You were never meant to win—you were meant to stop playing."*

---

**Post-Discovery:**

Once The Infinite is accessed, the game saves **Stellarian Archon** status to player profile. On subsequent playthroughs, a faint **Sirius marker** appears on HUD for that player only—they can teach others by example, but the secret must be discovered personally.

The first player to reach The Infinite receives 10% of proceeds—but they must **provide a written explanation** of how they discovered it, proving they understood the geometry and symbolism, not just stumbled upon it through random experimentation.

- **Cartesian basis**: X, Y, Z directions (for hybrid targeting)
- RT-pure ballistics (quadrance-based range, no √ calculations)
- **Instantaneous RT spread targeting** vs enemy's slow transcendental angle calculations
- **Visual properties scale with ship tier**:
  - Tetrahedron: Thin rays (lineWidth = 1)
  - Octahedron: Medium rays (lineWidth = 2)
  - Icosahedron: Thick rays (lineWidth = 3)
  - Stellated: Ultra-thick glowing rays (lineWidth = 4, emissive glow)
- **Range**: Q_max = 100 (quadrance units) base, +20 per ship tier

**Targeting Computer:**
- **Quadrance Lock**: Display Q values to targets (no √ needed!)
- **Spread Indicator**: Show spread values (s, 2-decimal precision) for firing solution
  - Player: 0.01 spread precision (granular, algebraic)
  - Enemies: 45°/15°/5°/1° degree intervals (coarse, transcendental)
- **Lead Calculation**: RT-pure intercept vectors (predictive firing)
- **Weak Point Detection**: Identify enemy **surface panel vulnerabilities** (vertices/edges are armored)
- **Firing Mode Toggle** (F key):
  - **Face Normal Mode**: Fires along polyhedron face normals (standard)
  - **Vertex Mode** (Stellated ships only): Fires along vertex vectors (piercing damage)

**X-RAY Telemetry System:**
- **Activation**: Press **X** key (costs 5 fuel per second active)
- **Effect**: Reveals enemy XYZ movement paths projected 3 seconds into future
- **Visualization**: Ghosted wireframe trail showing planned trajectory
  - Example display: "Cube: X +10 → Z +5 → Y -7 → X +3"
  - Trajectory rendered as dotted line with axis labels
- **Tactical use**: Position ship to intercept or evade, exploit enemy XYZ limitations
- **Educational value**: Demonstrates Cartesian coordinate mapping visually
- **Fuel cost vs points**: Costs fuel but enables higher-scoring evasive maneuvers
- **Limitation**: Only shows XYZ paths (not WXYZ) - player has 4D knowledge advantage

**Tetrahedral Photon Torpedoes (Ultimate Weapon):**
- **Unlock Requirement**: Accumulate 500 fuel units from captured Cartesian debris
- **Activation**: Press **CTRL + Spacebar** (costs 100 fuel per torpedo)
- **Geometry**: Perfect regular tetrahedron of **concentrated photonic energy**
- **Behavior**:
  - Fires along current facing vector (player ship orientation)
  - Travels at 3× speed of laser darts
  - **Seeks weak points**: Auto-corrects trajectory toward enemy surface panels using RT spread calculations
  - Rotates as it travels (4-fold tetrahedral spin for visual effect)
  - Emits brilliant cyan trail (tetrahedral axis webbing behind projectile)
- **Damage**:
  - Cube Drones: 5× damage (instant destruction of 5 cubes in Q < 10 radius)
  - Sphere Pods: 3× damage (penetrates UV-mapping, destroys 3 spheres)
  - Cartesian Cruisers: 2× damage (pierces stellation armor)
  - Classical Boss: 1× damage to **all** panels (weakens entire sphere simultaneously)
- **Visual Effect on Hit**:
  - Tetrahedral explosion: 4 photonic shockwaves expand along face normals
  - Enemy geometry **inverts briefly** (preview of black hole transition)
  - Debris field scatters in perfect tetrahedral symmetry
- **Reload**: 30-second cooldown after each torpedo
- **Lore**: *"The Tablets speak of light contained in the fundament—four becoming one, one becoming infinite. This is the weapon of the Stellarian Archons, who learned to collapse photons into tetrahedral nodes and release them as judgment upon hubris."*
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates **4-fold symmetry vs 3-fold**, shows **focused energy superiority** over dispersed laser fire

### 2.4 Explosion & Resource Capture Mechanics

**Enemy Explosion Behavior (XYZ Planar Fragmentation):**

When enemies are destroyed, they exhibit **classical XYZ planar fragmentation** - a visual demonstration of Cartesian coordinate limitations:

1. **Cube Drones**:
   - 6 square faces blow apart along X, Y, Z axis planes
   - Faces fly outward perpendicular to their original orientation
   - Fragments disintegrate into pixel particles after 0.5 seconds
   - Debris field: 1 fuel orb (green glow), 1 cube material chunk (orange wireframe cube)

2. **Sphere Pods**:
   - UV-mapped surface fragments into latitude/longitude strips
   - Strips peel away from center along XY plane, then Z-axis
   - Demonstrates UV sphere inefficiency (512 triangles fragmenting)
   - Debris field: 2 fuel orbs, 1 sphere material (magenta wireframe sphere)

3. **Cartesian Cruisers**:
   - Stellated cube geometry fragments: core cube + stellation spikes separate
   - Core explodes in XYZ planar pattern, spikes fly off along vertex vectors
   - Debris field: 3 fuel orbs, 2 mixed materials

4. **Classical Boss**:
   - Catastrophic multi-stage XYZ explosion:
     - Stage 1: Weakened panel implodes
     - Stage 2: Latitude strips peel away from equator
     - Stage 3: Longitude strips fragment from poles
     - Stage 4: Core collapses to point, explosive shockwave
   - Debris field: Massive scatter - 50 fuel orbs, 10 material chunks

**Player Ship Explosions (Polyhedral Fragmentation):**

When player ship is destroyed, it exhibits **RT-pure polyhedral fragmentation** - demonstrating tetrahedral symmetry:

- **Tetrahedron**: 4 faces fly apart along face normals (tetrahedral symmetry)
- **Octahedron**: 8 faces fly apart along face normals (octahedral symmetry)
- **Icosahedron**: 20 faces fly apart along face normals (icosahedral symmetry)
- **Cuboctahedron**: 14 faces (8 triangular + 6 square) fly apart along face normals
- Fragments glow with ship's color scheme, fade to black over 1 second
- "Game Over" message appears as fragments disperse

**Resource Capture System:**

- **Fuel Orbs** (green glowing spheres):
  - Auto-attracted to player ship within Q < 25 (quadrance range)
  - Manual collection: Fly through debris field
  - Avoid collision with solid debris chunks (causes damage!)

- **Material Chunks** (colored wireframe geometry):
  - Must be **captured manually** by flying through them
  - Each material type has signature color:
    - Cube material: Orange wireframe cube
    - Sphere material: Magenta wireframe sphere
    - Mixed material: Cyan composite geometry
  - Chunks are **solid** - collision causes minor damage (Q_damage = 5)
  - Risk/reward: Navigate debris field to capture materials

- **Tractor Beam Mechanic** (T key - Advanced Ships Only):
  - Stellated ships unlock tractor beam ability
  - Creates conical attraction field (45° cone, Q_range = 50)
  - Pulls fuel orbs AND materials toward ship
  - Costs 2 fuel/second active
  - Tactical use: Safe debris collection from distance

### 2.5 Hyperspace Matrix Deployment

**Mechanic:**
- Press **H** to enter Hyperspace state
- **Requirement**: Cuboctahedron Mothership unlocked (20 materials + 200 fuel invested)
- Spawns **IVM Matrix Army**: 3×3×3 lattice array (27 units) of mini-polyhedra
- Matrix units **auto-attack nearest enemy** using RT-pure tracking
- Matrix envelops target enemy, fires inward from all angles
- **Friendly Fire Warning**: Single coordinated volley only - second volley destroys swarm
- Matrix collapses after 10 seconds or when all units destroyed
- **Cooldown**: 30 seconds
- **Fuel cost**: 50 fuel per deployment

**Matrix Unit Types:**
- Mini-tetrahedra (fast, low damage) - corner positions
- Mini-octahedra (balanced) - edge positions
- Mini-cuboctahedra (high damage) - face-center positions
- All units share IVM lattice structure - demonstrates space-filling tetrahedral packing 

### 2.6 Black Hole Level Transitions

**Sequence:**
1. Destroy all enemies in current wave/level
2. **Black hole polyhedron** appears at origin
3. Complex nested geometry (e.g., Geodesic Icosahedron freq-6)
4. Geometry **collapses** toward origin over 3 seconds
5. Screen inverts: **white background, color negation** (spreads from centre outward, following polyhedron edge boundaries)
6. Player ship enters "negative space"
7. Geometry **re-expands** from origin in inverted palette, then collapes again to next level...
8. Transition complete → Next wave begins

**Visual Effects:**
- Geometry collapse: Vertices converge to [1,1,1,1] origin
- Color inversion: RGB → (255-R, 255-G, 255-B)
- Particle effects along tetrahedral axes during transition

### 2.7 Geodesic Window Tracking (HUD View)

**Dual View System:**

**1. Geodesic HUD (First-Person):**
- **Wrap-around spherical display** projected on geodesic icosahedron
- Shows 360° battle theater from player ship perspective
- Enemy positions mapped to geodesic triangular panels
- RT quadrance distances displayed on each panel
- Target reticle highlights current firing solution

**2. Coordinate Space View (Third-Person):**
- Traditional ARTexplorer viewport
- Shows player ship at origin with camera orbit
- Enemies positioned in WXYZ space around ship
- Visualize W/X/Y/Z basis vectors as colored arrows
- Papercut mode available for tactical cross-sections - allows to see greater theatre distance like radar, where the next wave might be coming from

**Toggle**: Press **V** to switch between HUD and Coordinate views

### 2.8 Quadray Grid Visualization (Strategic Movement Aid)

**Activation**: Press **G** to toggle Quadray grid visibility

**Visual Design:**
- **Tetrahedral lattice grid** extending from player origin
- Four tetrahedral axes (W, X, Y, Z) rendered as glowing webbed lines
- Grid extends to Q = 120 units (well past combat range)
- Lines are semi-transparent (opacity = 0.3) to avoid obstructing view
- **Color coding** (Quadray WXYZ tetrahedral axes):
  - W-axis grid: Red webbing
  - X-axis grid: Green webbing
  - Y-axis grid: Blue webbing
  - Z-axis grid: Yellow webbing
- Grid intensity increases during strategic maneuvers:
  - Tetrahedral dodge: Corresponding axis grid glows brighter (opacity → 0.7)
  - Quadray firing: Relevant axis grid pulses with shot
  - Hyperspace deployment: All grids glow simultaneously

**Strategic Use:**
- **Long-range theater awareness**: See approaching enemy waves before they enter combat range
- **Quadray movement visualization**: Grid shows tetrahedral directions clearly
- **Educational value**: Demonstrates 4-axis tetrahedral coordinate system vs 3-axis Cartesian
- **Nostalgic aesthetic**: Neon-vector 80's wireframe grid (homage to Tron, Battlezone)

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Module Structure

```
game-modules/
├── rt-asteroids-core.js          ← Game loop, state management
├── rt-asteroids-player.js        ← Ship controls, physics
├── rt-asteroids-enemies.js       ← Enemy AI, spawning
├── rt-asteroids-weapons.js       ← Laser darts, collision detection
├── rt-asteroids-matrix.js        ← Hyperspace IVM army
├── rt-asteroids-blackhole.js     ← Level transitions
├── rt-asteroids-hud.js           ← Geodesic HUD rendering
└── rt-asteroids-scoring.js       ← Score, fuel, materials, health, wave tracking
```

**Leverage Existing ARTexplorer Modules:**
- `rt-rendering.js`: Scene, camera, lighting
- `rt-polyhedra.js`: Ship and enemy geometry generation
- `rt-math.js`: Quadray conversion, quadrance, spread
- `rt-matrix.js`: IVM matrix army generation
- `rt-papercut.js`: Tactical cutplane views - all camera options

### 3.2 Coordinate System Strategy

**Player Ship Always at Origin:**
- Ship position = [1,1,1,1] normalized Quadray origin
- **World moves relative to player** (classic Asteroids approach)
- Enemies positioned in WXYZ space around origin
- Camera orbits player ship (or locks in HUD mode)

**Enemy Tracking Limitations:**
- Enemies store positions in **XYZ-only** (3-axis Cartesian):
  - **Translation only**: UP/DOWN (Z), LEFT/RIGHT (X), FORWARD/BACK (Y)
  - Cubes: No rotation capability
  - Spheres & Cruisers: Can rotate, but at computational cost
- **Cannot detect WXYZ tetrahedral movement patterns**
  - Player can move in Quadray W/X/Y/Z basis directions
  - Enemies perceive XYZ-projected position only (missing W-component)
  - Example: Player moves +W → Enemy sees partial XYZ shift, confused tracking
- **Quadray "Dodge" Maneuver**:
  - When player moves in Quadray tetrahedral directions, enemies lose targeting lock
  - Appears as instantaneous lateral shift from enemy perspective (Cartesian sensors cannot track tetrahedral motion)
  - Costs extra fuel but evades Cartesian firing solutions
  - Visual: Tetrahedral grid web extends along corresponding axis during dodge
- **Angular Precision Handicap**:
  - Player: RT spread targeting (0.01 precision, algebraic)
  - Enemies: Degree-based targeting (45°/15°/5°/1° depending on level)
  - At long range (Q > 50), player can move out of enemy's angular resolution
  - X-RAY telemetry reveals enemy's coarse angular steps visually

### 3.3 RT-Pure Ballistics

**Laser Dart Physics:**
1. Player fires along tetrahedral basis vector (W, X, Y, or Z) - Face-normal darts are possible but vertex darts might be stronger?
2. Dart velocity = basis vector × speed scalar
3. Dart position updated each frame: `Q_new = Q_old + v²Δt`
4. Collision detection: `Q_target < Q_threshold` (no √ needed!)
5. Range limit: `Q_max = 100` (quadrance units)

**Collision Detection:**
```javascript
// RT-pure collision (no distance calculation)
function checkCollision(dart, enemy) {
  const Q = RT.quadrance(dart.pos, enemy.pos); // Δx²+Δy²+Δz²+Δw²
  return Q < (dart.radius + enemy.radius)**2; // Compare Q, not d!
}
```

### 3.4 Geodesic HUD Rendering

**Implementation:**
1. Create Geodesic Icosahedron (freq-3) at player origin
2. Each triangular face = HUD panel
3. Ray-cast from player to enemies
4. Determine which geodesic face ray intersects
5. Render enemy symbol on that HUD panel
6. Display quadrance value and threat level

**Advantages:**
- Natural 360° spherical coverage
- RT-pure angular sectors (no arctan needed)
- Educational: Demonstrates geodesic sphere superiority over UV sphere

## 6. Educational Value

### 6.1 Learning Objectives

**Primary Concepts:**
1. **Quadray Coordinates**: 4-axis tetrahedral space vs 3-axis Cartesian
2. **Rational Trigonometry**: Quadrance (Q) vs Distance (d), Spread (s) vs Angle (θ)
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Algebraic geometry vs transcendental functions
4. **Geodesic Geometry**: Icosahedron subdivision vs UV sphere mapping
5. **IVM Lattice**: Space-filling tetrahedral arrays

**Gameplay-Integrated Teaching:**
- **Quadray tetrahedral advantage**: Player navigates full WXYZ space while enemies are constrained to XYZ Cartesian
- **RT targeting speed**: Player weapons lock-on instantly (no angle calculation), enemy weapons lag (slow trig functions)
- **Geodesic efficiency**: HUD demonstrates superior triangle distribution
- **Matrix deployment**: Shows IVM spatial packing principles

### 6.2 Tutorial Level Design

**Tutorial Sequence:**
1. **Introduction**: "Welcome to Quadray space. You have 4 axes: W, X, Y, Z."
2. **Movement Practice**: "Press ASDF to move in Quadray WXYZ space. Notice enemies cannot track tetrahedral motion."
3. **Combat Basics**: "Press Spacebar to fire laser darts. No angle calculation needed!"
4. **Quadrance Concept**: "Your HUD shows Q (quadrance), not d (distance). Q = d². Simpler!"
5. **Hyperspace**: "Press H to deploy IVM Matrix army. Watch them auto-target enemies."
6. **Black Hole**: "Destroy all enemies to trigger level transition. Watch the geometry!"

### 6.3 On-Screen Educational Tooltips

**During Gameplay:**
- "Enemy tracking failed: Cannot compute Quadray-axis component"
- "RT targeting: 0ms lock-on (algebraic)"
- "Enemy targeting: 120ms lock-on (transcendental functions)"
- "Geodesic HUD: 180 triangles vs Classical Sphere: 512 triangles"
- "Quadrance Q = 25 (distance d ≈ 5, but no √ needed!)"

## 11. Conclusion

**A.r.t.steroids** transforms ARTexplorer from a visualization tool into an interactive educational game that teaches Rational Trigonometry through engaging gameplay. By giving players geometric superpowers (Quadray navigation, RT targeting, Geodesic HUD) and pitting them against classically-limited enemies, the game creates memorable "aha!" moments that cement understanding of abstract mathematical concepts.

Aesthetic is nostalgiac for Gen-Xer's with a neon-vector feel, slightly richer than the original, but completely avoiding hyper-realism as a cost of compute, prefer simplicity to maintain abstract 80's art feel and linear minimalism with geometry as they key interest factor, the compelling complexity. The QUADRAY central angle webbed-grid will be made visible during strategic movement (extending well past our 120 unit intervals.)

The game leverages ARTexplorer's existing RT-pure architecture while adding new modules for combat, AI, and level progression. The 12-week implementation roadmap is realistic and modular, allowing for incremental testing and refinement.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
1. **Navigate WXYZ + XYZ space** - Use both tetrahedral AND Cartesian basis vectors
2. **Fire RT Spread-based laser darts** - Instant 0.01-precision algebraic targeting
3. **Exploit enemy XYZ limitations** - Enemies constrained to UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/FORWARD/BACK translation
4. **Use X-RAY telemetry** - See enemy XYZ paths 3 seconds into future (costs fuel)
5. **Capture debris** - Collect fuel orbs + material chunks from enemy explosions
6. **Upgrade ships progressively** - Tetra → Octa → Icosa → Cubocta → Stellated
7. **Deploy IVM Matrix armies** - Hyperspace 3×3×3 swarm (Cuboctahedron Mothership only)
8. **Survive enemy waves** - Outmaneuver coarse degree-based targeting (45°→1°)
9. **Transit through black holes** - Polyhedral collapse/expansion with color inversion
10. **Repeat with increasing difficulty** - Enemy angular precision improves per wave

**Key Tactical Advantages:**
- **Quadray tetrahedral dodge**: Enemy Cartesian tracking fails, appears as instant lateral shift from their perspective
- **RT Spread precision**: 0.01 granularity vs enemy's 45°/15°/5°/1° coarse intervals
- **Long-range exploitation**: At Q > 50, move out of enemy angular resolution
- **X-RAY future sight**: Predict enemy XYZ paths, position for intercept
- **Resource management**: Balance fuel costs (X-RAY/Tractor/Hyperspace) vs combat needs
- **Risk/reward debris capture**: Navigate explosion fragments for materials

**Visual & Educational Highlights:**
- **Explosion contrast**: Enemy XYZ planar fragmentation vs Player polyhedral face-normal fragmentation
- **Quadray grid**: Tetrahedral lattice webbing (nostalgic 80's neon-vector aesthetic)
- **X-RAY telemetry**: Visual demonstration of Cartesian coordinate mapping
- **Geodesic HUD**: 180 triangle geodesic icosa vs enemy's 512 triangle UV sphere
- **Angular precision handicap**: Player's smooth RT spread vs enemy's stepped degrees
- **Progressive ship evolution**: Stellations and duals demonstrate geometric hybridization

**Educational Payoff:**
Players naturally discover that:
- **Tetrahedral WXYZ + Cartesian XYZ navigation** > XYZ-only navigation
- **Quadrance (Q) > Distance (d)** for computation (no √ needed)
- **RT Spread (0.01 precision) > Angles (1° precision)** for targeting granularity
- **Geodesic subdivision (180 tri) > UV sphere (512 tri)** for polygon efficiency
- **Algebraic geometry (instant) > Transcendental functions (delayed)** for speed
- **4-axis knowledge > 3-axis perception** for tactical superiority

**A.r.t.steroids** proves that mathematics education doesn't have to be dry—it can be an epic space battle where geometry itself is your greatest weapon.

```javascript
// rt-asteroids-core.js
export const AsteroidsGame = (() => {
  let gameState = 'MENU'; // MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER, TRANSITION
  let wave = 1;
  let score = 0;
  let player = null;
  let enemies = [];
  let lasers = [];

  function init() {
    player = createPlayerShip('tetrahedron');

  }

  function update(deltaTime) {
    if (gameState !== 'PLAYING') return;

    updatePlayer(deltaTime);
    updateEnemies(deltaTime);
    updateLasers(deltaTime);
    checkCollisions();

    if (enemies.length === 0) {
      triggerBlackHoleTransition();
    }
  }

  function render() {
    // Handled by rt-rendering.js
  }

  return { init, update, render };
})();
```

### A.2 RT-Pure Collision Detection

```javascript
// rt-asteroids-weapons.js
function checkLaserEnemyCollision(laser, enemy) {
  // Convert both to Quadray if needed
  const laserQ = laser.posQuadray;
  const enemyQ = enemy.posQuadray;

  // Calculate quadrance (NO SQUARE ROOT!)
  const Q = RT.quadrance(laserQ, enemyQ);

  // Collision threshold (combined radii squared)

  return Q < threshold;
}
```

### A.3 W-Axis Enemy Blindness

```javascript
// rt-asteroids-enemies.js
function updateCubeEnemy(enemy, playerPos, deltaTime) {
  // Cube enemy only tracks XYZ (cannot perceive Quadray tetrahedral motion)
  const playerXYZ = RT.quadrayToCartesian(playerPos);
  const enemyXYZ = RT.quadrayToCartesian(enemy.pos);

  // Classical angle-based tracking (SLOW)
  const dx = playerXYZ.x - enemyXYZ.x;
  const dy = playerXYZ.y - enemyXYZ.y;
  const dz = playerXYZ.z - enemyXYZ.z;

  const angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx); // Transcendental = delay!

  // Enemy moves in XYZ only
  enemy.velocity = {
    x: Math.cos(angle) * enemy.speed,
    y: Math.sin(angle) * enemy.speed,
    z: dz > 0 ? enemy.speed : -enemy.speed,
    w: 0 // CANNOT TRACK W-AXIS!
  };

  // Update position
  enemy.pos = RT.addQuadrays(enemy.pos, enemy.velocity, deltaTime);
}
```

### A.4 Geodesic HUD Mapping

```javascript
// rt-asteroids-hud.js
function mapEnemyToHUDPanel(enemy, playerPos, hudGeodesic) {
  // Vector from player to enemy

  // Find which geodesic face this vector intersects
  const ray = new THREE.Raycaster(
    new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0), // Origin
    RT.quadrayToCartesian(direction).normalize()
  );

  const intersects = ray.intersectObject(hudGeodesic);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const faceIndex = intersects[0].faceIndex;
    const Q = RT.quadrance(playerPos, enemy.pos);

    // Render enemy indicator on this HUD panel
    renderEnemyIndicator(faceIndex, Q, enemy.threatLevel);
  }
}
```

## Appendix C: Developer Implementation Notes (INTERNAL - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION)

### C.1 Legal Framework: Skill-Based Gaming vs Gambling

**Challenge:**
Ontario's gaming laws (Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario - AGCO) heavily regulate gambling and gaming. Commercial operators like BetRivers and BetMGM operate under specific licenses that are expensive and restrictive. We need to structure A.r.t.steroids to avoid gambling classification.

**Legal Strategy:**

**1. Skill-Based Game Classification:**
- **Key Distinction**: Games of skill (chess, esports) vs games of chance (slots, poker)
- **A.r.t.steroids qualifies as skill-based** because:
  - Victory requires knowledge acquisition (Gurdjieff, Sirius, Dymaxion geometry)
  - Discovery path demands research, not luck or random chance
  - Written explanation requirement proves understanding, not accidental discovery
  - No randomness determines winner (unlike lottery/raffles)

**2. Prize Structure (Contest of Skill):**
- **One-time purchase**: $50 CAD for lifetime access to game
- **Prize pool**: 10% of all revenue goes to first discoverer of The Infinite
- **Legal precedent**: Similar to coding competitions, CTF (Capture The Flag) security contests, puzzle hunts
  - Example: MIT Mystery Hunt (free, but conceptually similar)
  - Example: Cicada 3301 puzzle (had corporate backing, legal)
  - Example: Esports tournaments (pay-to-enter, skill-based prizes)

**3. Ontario-Specific Compliance:**
- **Not a lottery** (Criminal Code s.207): No element of chance, pure skill
- **Not gambling** (AGCO definition): Outcome determined by player knowledge, not random events
- **Commercial contest exemption**: If skill substantially outweighs chance, exempt from lottery regulations
- **Written explanation requirement** provides legal proof of skill (not random discovery)

**4. Terms of Service Requirements:**
```
CONTEST RULES - A.R.T.STEROIDS "THE INFINITE" PRIZE

1. ELIGIBILITY: Open to legal residents of jurisdictions where skill-based gaming contests are permitted. Void where prohibited.

2. ENTRY: Purchase of game ($50 CAD) grants unlimited attempts to discover The Infinite.

3. PRIZE DETERMINATION: First player to access The Infinite AND provide written explanation demonstrating understanding of geometric/philosophical discovery method wins 10% of gross game revenue to date.

4. SKILL REQUIREMENT: Discovery requires research (Gurdjieff philosophy, Sirius astronomy, Dymaxion cartography, Rational Trigonometry), symbolic interpretation, and execution of counter-intuitive gameplay action. No element of chance involved.

5. VERIFICATION: Winner must submit written explanation proving intentional discovery (not accidental). Developer reserves right to reject explanations lacking demonstrated understanding.

6. PRIZE PAYMENT: Via certified cheque (Canada Post) or wire transfer within 30 days of verification.

7. SUBSEQUENT PLAYERS: After first winner, achievement remains accessible but no additional monetary prize awarded. "Stellarian Archon" status granted.

8. NO PURCHASE NECESSARY ALTERNATIVE: Not applicable - this is a commercial software product with integrated skill contest, not a lottery requiring free entry method.
```

**5. Tax Implications (Canada):**
- **Winner**: Prize likely treated as "windfall" (non-taxable in Canada if truly one-time skill contest prize)
- **Developer**: Revenue is taxable business income, prize is deductible business expense
- **GST/HST**: Charged on $50 game purchase (digital goods)
- **Consult tax lawyer**: Confirm CRA treatment before launch

**6. Risk Mitigation:**
- **Legal opinion**: Obtain written legal opinion from Ontario gaming lawyer confirming skill-based classification
- **Insurance**: Consider prize indemnity insurance if prize pool could become large
- **Escrow account**: Deposit 10% of revenue into separate account as prize pool (shows good faith)

### C.2 Anti-Cheat & Code Obfuscation

**Challenge:**
Players will attempt to reverse-engineer the JavaScript to discover The Infinite path without solving puzzles. We must protect the secret while allowing legitimate discovery.

**Implementation Strategy:**

**1. Server-Side Validation (Required):**
```javascript
// Client-side game runs in browser, BUT:
// Achievement unlock must verify with server before prize claim

// rt-asteroids-anticheat.js (SERVER-SIDE - Node.js/Express)
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Generate cryptographic proof that player achieved The Infinite legitimately
function generateAchievementProof(playerSession) {
  // Server tracks:
  // - Total game time
  // - Wave progression
  // - Plimpton 322 trial completion timestamp
  // - Tetrahedral trial completion timestamp
  // - Time spent at origin [1,1,1,1] during combat
  // - Sirius alignment duration

  const proofData = {
    sessionId: playerSession.id,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    plimptonSecret: playerSession.plimptonUnlocked,
    tetrahedralSecret: playerSession.tetrahedralUnlocked,
    originDuration: playerSession.originStillnessSeconds, // Must be >= 300
    siriusAlignment: playerSession.siriusAlignmentVerified,
    totalPlaytime: playerSession.totalSeconds
  };

  // Cryptographic signature (cannot be forged without server private key)
  const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', process.env.SERVER_SECRET_KEY)
    .update(JSON.stringify(proofData))
    .digest('hex');

  return { ...proofData, signature };
}

// Verify proof when player submits written explanation
function verifyInfiniteDiscovery(proof, explanation) {
  // 1. Verify cryptographic signature
  // 2. Check all conditions met (300s stillness, both secrets, etc.)
  // 3. Manually review written explanation (human verification)
  // 4. If valid: Mark as winner, calculate prize, initiate payment
}
```

**2. Code Obfuscation (Client-Side):**
```bash
# Use JavaScript obfuscation tools for production build

# Install obfuscator
npm install -g javascript-obfuscator

# Obfuscate all game modules (makes reverse-engineering extremely difficult)
javascript-obfuscator ./game-modules/ \
  --output ./dist/game-modules/ \
  --compact true \
  --control-flow-flattening true \
  --control-flow-flattening-threshold 0.75 \
  --dead-code-injection true \
  --dead-code-injection-threshold 0.4 \
  --string-array true \
  --string-array-encoding 'rc4' \
  --string-array-threshold 0.75 \
  --unicode-escape-sequence true
```

**3. Split Secret Architecture:**
```javascript
// The true victory condition is SPLIT across client and server
// Neither alone reveals the full secret

// CLIENT: Detects geometric conditions, sends encrypted telemetry
function checkOriginAlignment() {
  const atOrigin = (Q_fromOrigin < 0.01);
  const stillnessDuration = (Date.now() - lastMovementTime) / 1000;
  const gridActive = quadrayGridVisible;
  const siriusAligned = checkSiriusAlignment(); // Checks constellation overlay

  if (atOrigin && stillnessDuration > 10 && gridActive && siriusAligned) {
    // Send encrypted heartbeat to server every 10 seconds
    sendTelemetry({
      type: 'ORIGIN_STILLNESS',
      duration: stillnessDuration,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      wave: currentWave,
      encrypted: encryptPayload({ atOrigin, siriusAligned })
    });
  }
}

// SERVER: Accumulates telemetry, verifies 300-second requirement
// Only server knows the threshold is 300 seconds
// Client code shows no hint of required duration
```

**4. Decoy Code Injection:**
```javascript
// rt-asteroids-decoys.js (obfuscated in production)

// Inject plausible but FALSE victory conditions into client code
function checkFalseVictoryConditions() {
  // These will never trigger The Infinite, but will mislead code readers

  // DECOY 1: High Evasion Ratio (mentioned in design doc as false path)
  if (evasionScore / destructionScore > 3.0) {
    console.log('[HIDDEN] High evasion ratio detected...'); // Red herring
    // Does nothing
  }

  // DECOY 2: Boss defeat with specific loadout
  if (bossDefeated && ship.type === 'ICOSAHEDRON' && torpedoesUsed === 0) {
    console.log('[HIDDEN] Pacifist boss victory...'); // Red herring
    // Does nothing
  }

  // DECOY 3: Specific score threshold
  if (totalScore === 133700) { // Plimpton 322 reference number
    console.log('[HIDDEN] Plimpton resonance...'); // Red herring
    // Does nothing
  }
}

// REAL victory condition is in separate obfuscated module
// Requires server-side validation anyway
```

**5. License Key System (DRM):**
```javascript
// Each $50 purchase generates unique license key
// Game phones home to verify key on launch
// Prevents piracy, enables tracking for prize pool calculation

// rt-asteroids-license.js (SERVER-SIDE)
function generateLicenseKey(purchaseId, email) {
  const keyData = {
    id: purchaseId,
    email: crypto.createHash('sha256').update(email).digest('hex').substring(0, 16),
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    version: '1.0'
  };

  // Sign with server private key
  const signature = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
  signature.update(JSON.stringify(keyData));
  const signed = signature.sign(serverPrivateKey, 'base64');

  return `ART-${Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(keyData)).toString('base64')}-${signed}`;
}

// CLIENT: Verifies key with server before allowing play
async function verifyLicense(licenseKey) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.artsteroids.com/verify-license', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ key: licenseKey })
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    alert('Invalid license key. Please purchase at artsteroids.com');
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

**6. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:**
```javascript
// SERVER: Prevent players from brute-forcing discovery by rapid restarts

// Track player attempts (by IP + license key)
const attemptLimits = new Map();

function trackDiscoveryAttempt(licenseKey, ipAddress) {
  const key = `${licenseKey}:${ipAddress}`;
  const attempts = attemptLimits.get(key) || { count: 0, firstAttempt: Date.now() };

  attempts.count++;
  attemptLimits.set(key, attempts);

  // If > 100 attempts in 24 hours, flag as suspicious
  const hoursSinceFirst = (Date.now() - attempts.firstAttempt) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  if (attempts.count > 100 && hoursSinceFirst < 24) {
    flagSuspiciousActivity(licenseKey, 'Excessive discovery attempts');
  }
}
```

---

### C.3 Prize Pool Calculation & Payment

**Revenue Model:**
- **Game price**: $50 CAD per license
- **Prize pool**: 10% of gross revenue (before expenses)
- **Example**: 1000 sales = $50,000 revenue → $5,000 prize

**Prize Pool Tracking:**
```javascript
// SERVER: Real-time prize pool calculation (displayed on website)

async function getCurrentPrizePool() {
  const totalSales = await db.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchases WHERE status = "completed"');
  const prizePool = totalSales.count * 50 * 0.10; // 10% of revenue

  return {
    totalSales: totalSales.count,
    totalRevenue: totalSales.count * 50,
    prizePool: prizePool,
    currency: 'CAD'
  };
}

// Public API endpoint (no auth required)
app.get('/api/prize-pool', async (req, res) => {
  const pool = await getCurrentPrizePool();
  res.json(pool);
});
```

**Winner Verification Process:**

1. **Automated Detection**: Server detects player achieved The Infinite (300s origin stillness + secrets)
2. **Email Notification**: Player receives email with submission form link
3. **Written Explanation Submission**: Player submits essay explaining discovery process
4. **Manual Review**: Developers read explanation, verify it demonstrates understanding (not accidental discovery)
5. **Winner Announcement**: Public announcement on website (with player consent)
6. **Payment Processing**:
   ```javascript
   // Prize payment workflow
   async function processPrizePayment(winnerId) {
     const winner = await db.findWinner(winnerId);
     const prizePool = await getCurrentPrizePool();

     // Generate payment voucher
     const voucher = {
       recipient: winner.fullName,
       address: winner.mailingAddress,
       amount: prizePool.prizePool,
       currency: 'CAD',
       method: winner.preferredMethod, // 'cheque' or 'wire'
       issueDate: new Date(),
       memo: 'A.r.t.steroids - The Infinite Discovery Prize'
     };

     // If cheque: Mail via Canada Post registered mail
     // If wire: Process via business bank account

     // Tax reporting (if required - consult accountant)
     await issueTaxDocument(winner, prizePool.prizePool);

     // Update database
     await db.markPrizeAwarded(winnerId, voucher);
   }
   ```

**Post-Winner Game State:**
- First winner receives prize + Stellarian Archon status
- Subsequent players who discover The Infinite receive Stellarian Archon status only (no prize)
- Achievement remains permanently accessible (not disabled after first winner)
- Leaderboard shows all Archons with discovery timestamps

### C.4 Technology Stack (Production)

**Frontend (Client):**
- **Three.js** (WebGL rendering) - same as ARTexplorer
- **Obfuscated JavaScript** (production build only)
- **Web Crypto API** (client-side encryption for telemetry)
- **Service Worker** (offline play after first load, cache game assets)

**Backend (Server):**
- **Node.js + Express** (API server)
- **PostgreSQL** (license keys, player sessions, telemetry, winner data)
- **Redis** (rate limiting, session management)
- **Stripe API** (payment processing for $50 purchases)
- **AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2** (game asset hosting)
- **AWS Lambda / Cloudflare Workers** (serverless functions for license verification)

**Infrastructure:**
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (fast global delivery, DDoS protection)
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS required (Let's Encrypt certificates)
- **Domain**: `artsteroids.com` or similar
- **Analytics**: Privacy-respecting analytics (Plausible.io, not Google)

**Deployment Pipeline:**
```bash
# Build script for production deployment

#!/bin/bash
# build-production.sh

echo "Building A.r.t.steroids production release..."

# 1. Obfuscate client code
javascript-obfuscator ./game-modules/ --output ./dist/game-modules/ [options]

# 2. Minify HTML/CSS
html-minifier index.html -o dist/index.html
cleancss art.css -o dist/art.css

# 3. Bundle and compress assets
# (Three.js, textures, sounds)

# 4. Generate integrity hashes (Subresource Integrity)
openssl dgst -sha384 -binary dist/game-modules/rt-asteroids-core.js | openssl base64 -A

# 5. Upload to CDN
aws s3 sync ./dist/ s3://artsteroids-production/ --acl public-read

# 6. Deploy server API
git push heroku main  # or AWS/Cloudflare deployment

echo "Production build complete!"
```

### C.5 Ethical Considerations

**Transparency:**
- Prize pool amount is publicly visible on website
- Winner announcement (with consent) builds trust
- No hidden fees or deductions from prize

**Fairness:**
- All players have equal access to clues (embedded in game)
- No pay-to-win mechanics (single $50 purchase, unlimited attempts)
- Discovery requires understanding, not grinding or random luck

**Educational Mission:**
- Game genuinely teaches Rational Trigonometry and geometric philosophy
- Prize incentivizes deep engagement with mathematical concepts
- Written explanation requirement ensures learning occurred

**Privacy:**
- Minimal data collection (license key, play sessions for anti-cheat only)
- No selling of player data
- GDPR/PIPEDA compliance (players can request data deletion)

---

### C.6 Development Milestones (Prize-Enabled Release)

**Phase 1: Core Game (8 weeks)** - No prize, free beta testing
**Phase 2: Polish & Testing (4 weeks)** - Closed alpha with prize simulation
**Phase 3: Legal Review (2 weeks)** - Lawyer approval, terms of service finalized
**Phase 4: Server Infrastructure (2 weeks)** - License system, telemetry, prize tracking
**Phase 5: Security Audit (2 weeks)** - Penetration testing, obfuscation review
**Phase 6: Public Launch** - $50 sales begin, prize pool accumulates

**Total Timeline:** ~18 weeks (4.5 months) from start to public launch

---

### C.7 Contingency Planning

**What if no one discovers The Infinite within X years?**
- **Sunset clause**: After 3 years, if no winner, release official hint system
- **Progressive clues**: Year 1 (silent), Year 2 (subtle hint on website), Year 3 (direct clue)
- **Prize rollover**: Unclaimed prize could fund sequel game or donate to math education

**What if multiple players discover simultaneously?**
- **Server timestamp**: First to achieve 300-second stillness + submit valid explanation wins
- **Tie-breaker**: If within same 24-hour period, split prize equally

**What if winner is in jurisdiction where prize is illegal?**
- **Alternative award**: Offer equivalent value in non-cash prize (computer hardware, math course tuition, etc.)
- **Donation option**: Winner can choose to donate prize to charity (tax receipt)
