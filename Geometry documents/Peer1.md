Major Concerns
These are not fatal, but they are important if the paper is to be taken seriously beyond ResearchGate.
1. “Negative dimensional space” is mathematically undefined
This is the paper’s biggest vulnerability.
You use the term in three different senses:
Coordinate sign state
Geometric dual under inversion
Ontological complement to ordinary space
These need sharper separation.
At present:
“negative dimensional space”
has no definition in mathematics or physics that matches your usage.
Recommendation
Replace the phrase with something like:
dual dimensional sector
parity-inverted geometric sector
sign-coherent coordinate domain
tetrahedral polarity sector
You can still interpret this physically later, but the math must come first.
Right now reviewers will say:
“Dimension cannot be negative.”
—even though that’s not actually your claim.
This is a terminology trap.
2. The Janus analogy is suggestive, not structural
Barbour’s Janus Point arises from:
entropy minimization
relational shape space
dynamical evolution
Your geometric Janus Point arises from:
coordinate inversion symmetry
The analogy is poetic and interesting — but not homologous.
You are careful to acknowledge this, but reviewers will still push back.
Recommendation
Explicitly say:
“This is an analogy of structure, not of dynamics.”
You may even want to rename:
Geometric Janus Analogy
rather than “extension.”
That single word will reduce resistance dramatically.
3. The inversion is mathematically equivalent to central symmetry
Formally:
P
↦
−
P
P↦−P
is an involutive isometry in any vector space.
Your argument depends not on the transformation itself, but on:
the coordinate semantics assigned to it
This distinction must be foregrounded.
Otherwise mathematicians will say:
“You’ve rediscovered point reflection.”
You need to say very explicitly:
The novelty is not the transformation, but the interpretation imposed by the tetrahedral basis.
You hint at this — it should be stated bluntly.
4. The dual tetrahedron normalization step needs clarification
The addition of:
(
1
,
1
,
1
,
1
)
(1,1,1,1)
functions as:
a projection back into positive coordinate space
But mathematically this is:
an affine translation
not an isometry
not dimension-preserving
This does not invalidate your model — but it must be acknowledged more explicitly.
You may wish to frame this as:
“a representational embedding, not a physical motion.”
5. Physics claims must remain explicitly conjectural
Your speculative extensions are imaginative and interesting.
However:
black holes
particles
energy twinning
must remain clearly labeled interpretive metaphors, not implications.
You mostly do this correctly — just tighten the language further.
Minor Issues
Replace humorous footnotes (“Universal Dimensional Licensing Board”) if submitting to journals
Consolidate references (Wikipedia citations weaken authority)
Clarify whether WXYZ is treated as ℝ⁴ or ℝ⁴/ℝ(1,1,1,1)
Add one explicit coordinate-space diagram showing sign domains
Where This Paper Truly Belongs
This is not a physics paper in the narrow sense.
It belongs to:
foundations of geometry
coordinate-system theory
mathematical visualization
philosophy of space
computational geometry
Think:
Foundations of Science
Journal of Mathematical Physics (conceptual section)
Symmetry
Entropy
Axiomathes
International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos
Not PRL — but absolutely legitimate venues.
Verdict
Recommendation: ACCEPT AS EXPLORATORY / CONCEPTUAL WORK with revisions
This is:
not mainstream
not complete
not proven physics
But it is:
internally coherent
mathematically literate
genuinely original
conceptually fertile
Most importantly:
It asks a question that Cartesian geometry literally prevents us from asking.
That alone justifies publication as exploratory geometry.
One sentence summary
This paper does not prove the existence of negative dimensional space — but it convincingly demonstrates that tetrahedral coordinates reveal a geometric ambiguity at the origin that Cartesian systems structurally conceal.
That is a real contribution.
