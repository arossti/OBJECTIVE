## 1. Introduction

Quadray coordinates (also called WXYZ or tetrahedral coordinates) are a 4-dimensional coordinate system reflecting what R. Buckminster Fuller recognized as the _a priori_ 4-dimensional nature of space. Three dimensions is an arbitrary abstraction; the tetrahedron — requiring four vertices, four faces, and four directions from center — is the minimum structural system in Universe. Where Cartesian XYZ imposes three orthogonal axes at 90° angles as orthogonal orthodoxy, Quadray honors the inherent four-foldness of spatial reality with four equiangular axes emanating from a central origin toward the vertices of a regular tetrahedron (~109.47°). This foundation not only provides natural symmetry for tetrahedral and icosahedral geometry, but opens pathways to understanding hyperdimensionality — the 4D+ and 4D- spaces explored in subsequent sections emerge naturally from this coordinate system rather than as exotic additions.

**Key Properties:**

- 4 basis vectors at 109.47° angles (tetrahedral angle)
- Zero-sum constraint: W + X + Y + Z = constant (reduces 4 DOF to 3 DOF)
- Natural symmetry for tetrahedral and icosahedral geometry
- Spread between any two basis vectors = 3/4 (exact rational value)
- Rational Trigonometry principles use Quadrance to measure the separation of points in space (vertices) - not distance - and Spread measures the separation of lines in space - not degrees.

## 2. Quadray Basis Vectors, aka. 4D Coordinates, WXYZ, etc.

The four Quadray basis vectors point from the origin to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube. Using a Z-up convention:

| Basis | Quadray      | Cartesian Direction | Description       |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **W** | (1, 0, 0, 0) | (+1, +1, +1)/√3     | Top-front-right   |
| **X** | (0, 1, 0, 0) | (+1, -1, -1)/√3     | Bottom-back-right |
| **Y** | (0, 0, 1, 0) | (-1, +1, -1)/√3     | Bottom-front-left |
| **Z** | (0, 0, 0, 1) | (-1, -1, +1)/√3     | Top-back-left     |

**Geometric Relationships:**

- All basis vectors have equal magnitude
- Angle between any pair: arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°
- Spread between any pair: s = 1 - (-1/3)² = 8/9 ≈ 0.889
- Sum of all four basis vectors = (0, 0, 0) in Cartesian space — **vectorial neutrality**

**On Degrees of Freedom and Fuller's Vector Equilibrium:**

The Quadray system's 4 basis vectors achieve **vectorial neutrality** (sum to zero), but this is distinct from Fuller's claim about 12 vectors providing "complete restraint."

| Concept            | Vectors | What It Achieves                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quadray Basis**  | 4       | Vectorial neutrality (W+X+Y+Z = 0 in Cartesian); spans 3D space with 4D redundancy          |
| **Rigid Body DOF** | 6       | Standard mechanics: 3 translational + 3 rotational freedoms                                 |
| **Fuller's VE**    | 12      | Omnidirectional equilibrium of forces; radial vectors from center to cuboctahedron vertices |

**Fuller's 12-Vector Claim (Vector Equilibrium / Cuboctahedron):**

Fuller stated the Vector Equilibrium (VE) is "the only geometric form wherein all vectors are of equal length" — both the 12 radial vectors from center to vertices AND the 24 edge vectors. He described it as achieving "omnidirectional equilibrium of forces in which the magnitude of its explosive potentials is exactly matched by the strength of its external cohering bonds."

The 12 radial vectors of the VE comprise **6 pairs of opposite directions** (±X, ±Y, ±Z in Cartesian terms, though the VE's axes are not orthogonal). This 6-paired structure relates to the 6 degrees of freedom of a rigid body:

- 3 translational (forward/back, left/right, up/down)
- 3 rotational (pitch, yaw, roll)

**However**, Fuller's claim is about **force equilibrium**, not kinematic constraint. The VE's 12 vectors represent balanced omnidirectional thrust — if you push equally from all 12 directions toward center, the forces cancel. This is geometric/structural equilibrium, not the same as constraining 6 DOF in the mechanical engineering sense (which requires 6 constraints, not 12).

**The Quadray Connection:**

Our 4 Quadray basis vectors achieve a different kind of neutrality:

- They sum to zero vectorially (geometric balance)
- They provide a complete basis for 3D space (any point expressible as linear combination)
- The zero-sum constraint reduces 4 coordinates to 3 effective DOF

The VE's 12 vectors can be understood as **three sets of 4 Quadray-like tetrahedra** interpenetrating at the center — each set providing its own vectorial neutrality, and all three together providing omnidirectional coverage.

### 2.1 Native Degrees of Freedom: 3, 4, or 5?

**The Standard Claim (3 DOF):**

Quadray coordinates are conventionally described as providing 3 degrees of freedom. This arises from the **zero-sum constraint**: if W + X + Y + Z = k for some constant k, then knowing any three coordinates determines the fourth. This constraint is imposed to ensure Quadray maps onto Cartesian 3D space—it is a _compatibility requirement_, not an intrinsic property of tetrahedral coordinates.

**The Native Reality (4 DOF):**

However, the tetrahedron—the minimum structural system capable of enclosing space—requires **four vertices** to define. You cannot specify a tetrahedron with three coordinates; the fourth is not redundant information but essential geometric content.

Consider two points:

- **(1, 1, 1, 1)** — equidistant from all four basis directions (the dual tetrahedron vertex)
- **(1, 1, 1, 6)** — much closer to the Z-vertex than to W, X, or Y

With the zero-sum constraint, these would be "normalized" to equivalent positions. But they describe fundamentally different geometric relationships: the first is symmetric, the second is a **deformed tetrahedron** stretched along the Z-axis. The fourth coordinate carries real information that the constraint destroys.

| Framing                      | DOF       | What it describes                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Quadray as XYZ substitute    | 3         | Zero-sum constraint enforced; equivalent to Cartesian |
| Quadray as native system     | **4**     | Four independent coordinates; no external constraint  |
| Quadray with Janus extension | **4 + 1** | Four coordinates plus dimensional polarity (±)        |

**The Fifth Degree: Dimensional Polarity (License Pending)**

If we accept that positive and negative Quadray spaces (4D+ and 4D−) represent distinct dimensional realms separated by the Janus Point at origin, then a complete specification requires not only the four coordinates but also **which side of origin** the point occupies. This dimensional polarity is not a continuous degree of freedom but a discrete binary state—yet it represents information that four unsigned coordinates cannot capture.

Whether this constitutes a "fifth dimension" or merely a binary flag on a 4D system is a matter of interpretation. No dimensional licensing board exists to adjudicate the question. The framework is coherent either way.\*

_\*Application submitted to the Universal Dimensional Licensing Board, 2026.January.Earthtime. Awaiting response._

**Example: The Deformed Tetrahedron**

```
Regular tetrahedron vertices:     Deformed tetrahedron vertices:
  W: (1, 0, 0, 0)                   W: (1, 0, 0, 0)
  X: (0, 1, 0, 0)                   X: (0, 1, 0, 0)
  Y: (0, 0, 1, 0)                   Y: (0, 0, 1, 0)
  Z: (0, 0, 0, 1)                   Z: (0, 0, 0, 6)  ← stretched!

With zero-sum constraint:          Without constraint:
  Z would normalize to (0,0,0,1)     Z remains at (0,0,0,6)
  Information lost!                  Deformation preserved
```

The native Quadray system, without the zero-sum constraint, is a **4-dimensional coordinate system** that can describe tetrahedral deformations, asymmetries, and (with signed values) passage through the dimensional Janus Point. The 3 DOF interpretation is a projection onto Cartesian-compatible space—useful, but not the full picture.

### 2.2 Critical Clarification: Negative Coordinates ≠ Negative Dimensional Space

**For mathematicians and careful readers:** There is a crucial distinction between _negative coordinate values_ and _negative dimensional space_. Conflating these would be a category error.

**Movement vs. Inversion**

When you translate an object along the -W direction (past the origin on the W axis), the W coordinate becomes negative. But you have **not** changed dimensional state—you are still in positive dimensional space, just located in a region where one coordinate happens to be negative.

This is exactly analogous to Cartesian coordinates: moving from X = +5 to X = -5 doesn't transport you to another dimension. You're simply on the other side of the YZ plane.

**The 16 Regions of Full Signed Quadray Space**

In Cartesian XYZ:

- 3 axes × 2 directions = 6 axial directions
- 2³ = **8 octants** (all combinations of ±X, ±Y, ±Z)

In full signed WXYZ (without zero-sum constraint):

- 4 axes × 2 directions = **8 axial directions**
- 2⁴ = **16 regions** (all combinations of ±W, ±X, ±Y, ±Z)

| Sign Pattern | # Negative | Region Type        | Dimensional State                    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| (+,+,+,+)    | 0          | Canonical positive | **4D+** (positive dimensional space) |
| (+,+,+,−)    | 1          | Single-negative    | 4D+ (ordinary space)                 |
| (+,+,−,−)    | 2          | Double-negative    | 4D+ (ordinary space)                 |
| (+,−,−,−)    | 3          | Triple-negative    | 4D+ (ordinary space)                 |
| (−,−,−,−)    | 4          | Canonical negative | **4D−** (negative dimensional space) |

_Plus 11 additional permutations of the mixed-sign patterns._

**What Triggers Janus Inversion?**

The Janus Point transition occurs **only** when passing between the two canonical regions:

- **(+,+,+,+)** → all coordinates positive
- **(−,−,−,−)** → all coordinates negative

This happens through **scaling through zero** (the form itself collapses through the origin and re-emerges inverted), NOT through translation past zero on individual axes.

| Operation                    | Effect on Coordinates                            | Dimensional State Change? |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Translate along -W           | W goes negative, others unchanged                | **NO** — still in 4D+     |
| Translate along -W, -X       | W and X go negative                              | **NO** — still in 4D+     |
| Scale uniformly through zero | ALL coordinates pass through zero simultaneously | **YES** — 4D+ ↔ 4D−       |

**ARTexplorer Implementation**

This is exactly how ARTexplorer behaves:

- **Translation** along any axis allows coordinates to go negative without triggering Janus effects (no background inversion, no golden flash)
- **Scaling through zero** (via the gumball's central sphere) triggers the full Janus transition: golden flash at origin, background inverts black↔white, form emerges inverted

The 14 mixed-sign regions are simply **ordinary navigable space**—they're "over there" relative to origin, but they're not dimensionally inverted.

### 2.3 Summary: The Full Dimensional Accounting

| Aspect                  | Count     | Type            | Notes                         |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Basis vectors           | 4         | —               | W, X, Y, Z                    |
| Axial directions        | 8         | —               | ±W, ±X, ±Y, ±Z                |
| Spatial regions         | 16        | —               | 2⁴ sign combinations          |
| Continuous DOF (native) | **4**     | Continuous      | Position in tetrahedral space |
| Dimensional polarity    | **1**     | Discrete binary | 4D+ or 4D−                    |
| **Total specification** | **4 + 1** | Mixed           | 4 continuous + 1 binary       |

Whether to call this a "5-dimensional system" is a matter of convention. The dimensional polarity is not a continuous degree of freedom like the four spatial coordinates—it's a discrete binary state. One could argue:

- **"4D + binary flag"** — emphasizes the discrete nature of polarity
- **"5D"** — emphasizes that full specification requires 5 pieces of information
- **"4D±"** — our notation, which captures both the four continuous DOF and the ± polarity

We prefer **4D±** as the most precise description: a 4-dimensional continuous space with a discrete positive/negative dimensional state.

## 3. The Unit Tetrahedron

The unit tetrahedron in Quadray space has its four vertices located at the four basis directions:

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Notes         |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------- |
| V₀     | (1, 0, 0, 0)         | W-axis vertex |
| V₁     | (0, 1, 0, 0)         | X-axis vertex |
| V₂     | (0, 0, 1, 0)         | Y-axis vertex |
| V₃     | (0, 0, 0, 1)         | Z-axis vertex |

**Centroid:** (0, 0, 0, 0) — the origin

**Properties:**

- All edges have equal quadrance
- All faces are equilateral triangles
- This is the "quantum of space" in Fuller's Synergetics terminology

---

## 4. The Dual Tetrahedron

The dual tetrahedron shares the same centroid at origin but has its vertices pointing in the **opposite** directions — a 180° rotation (inversion) or Spread of 2x?, through the origin.

### 4.1 Negative Form (Raw Inversion = Negative Dimensional Tetrahedron, not merely dual?)

**The Topological Inversion Conjecture:**

Akin to the human experience of flipping either a sock or a duvet cover inside-out, the dual tetrahedron is inverted through the 'hole' of origin. The question is, topologically speaking, is origin actually a hole, or rather a dimensional transition point? Can a tetrahedron without an innate 'hole' be topologically inverted in this way? Or are we breaking a rule to do so? Are black holes really holes, or more akin to our origin idea?

**Classical Topology vs. Hyperdimensional Inversion:**

In classical topology, a closed surface (genus 0, like a sphere or tetrahedron) cannot be turned inside-out in 3D without tearing — it has no "hole" through which to pass material. This is why socks and duvet covers (genus 1, torus-like with an opening) CAN be inverted: they possess a boundary through which the transformation occurs.

Yet in Quadray space, we perform exactly this "forbidden" operation: the tetrahedron passes through origin to become its dual. This suggests one of three interpretations:

1. **Origin as Puncture (Topological Hole):**
   - The origin [0,0,0,0] acts as an infinitesimal "puncture" in the manifold
   - This puncture provides the boundary required for topological inversion
   - The tetrahedron effectively becomes genus 1 at the moment of transition

2. **Origin as Dimensional Transition Point:**
   - Origin is not a "hole" in the traditional sense but a **transition between positive and negative dimensional spaces**
   - The transformation doesn't require tearing because it occurs through dimensional transition
   - Analogous to passing through zero on a number line — not a hole, but a phase boundary
   - This preserves the genus 0 nature of the tetrahedron while permitting "inside-outing"

3. **Hyperdimensional Embedding (Preferred Interpretation):**
   - The inversion that appears impossible in 3D becomes trivial when embedded in 4D+ space
   - Just as a 2D creature cannot comprehend flipping a circle inside-out, but we can do so trivially via the third dimension...
   - ...so too the 3D tetrahedron can invert through a 4D embedding space
   - **The Quadray system's inherent 4-dimensionality provides this embedding**
   - Origin is the "contact point" where 4D+ and 4D- spaces touch

**Implications for Black Holes and General Relativity:**

If we adopt interpretation (2) or (3), a provocative analogy emerges:

| Concept                       | Traditional View                                                | Hyperdimensional Inversion View                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Black Hole Singularity**    | "Hole" in spacetime where matter is crushed to infinite density | **Dimensional transition point** where 3D matter passes into negative/inverted dimensional space |
| **Event Horizon**             | Point of no return                                              | Phase boundary between positive and negative dimensional manifolds                               |
| **Information Paradox**       | Information is "lost" in the singularity                        | Information is **inverted and preserved** in negative dimensional space (mirror universe)        |
| **White Holes** (theoretical) | Time-reversed black holes                                       | The **dual/inverted** output of black hole transition — matter re-emerging in positive space     |

**The Quadray Origin Model:**

In Quadray coordinates, the origin [0,0,0,0] is not merely "empty space" but the **neutral point** where all four basis vectors sum to zero. This zero-sum property suggests:

- Origin is simultaneously "everywhere" (the sum of all directions) and "nowhere" (the null point)
- It is the unique point belonging equally to both positive and negative dimensional spaces
- Passing through origin doesn't "tear" the manifold — it **rotates** through a higher dimension

This is precisely what a 180° rotation (inversion) accomplishes: not a topological tear, but a **rigid motion** through the higher-dimensional embedding space that the Quadray system naturally provides.

**Mathematical Note:**

The "inside-outing" of a tetrahedron through origin is mathematically equivalent to:

- Multiplication by -1 (sign inversion)
- 180° rotation in 4D space (reflection through origin)
- Application of the inversion matrix: diag(-1, -1, -1, -1) in Quadray space

All three descriptions are equivalent, and none requires a "hole" — only the existence of a higher-dimensional embedding, which Quadray coordinates inherently provide.

**Connection to Julian Barbour's Janus Point Theory:**

Our Quadray origin model bears striking resemblance to physicist Julian Barbour's "Janus Point" theory of time and cosmology. In Barbour's framework:

| Barbour's Janus Point                                                                                                   | Quadray Origin Model                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Big Bang is not a "beginning" but a **central pivot** — the Janus Point — from which time extends in two directions | Origin [0,0,0,0] is not "empty space" but a **neutral pivot** from which positive and negative dimensional spaces extend |
| The universe passed through a moment of **minimal size/complexity** at the Janus Point                                  | The tetrahedron passes through a point of **minimal extension** (origin) during inversion                                |
| Two **arrows of time** emerge from the Janus Point, each with increasing complexity/order                               | Two **dimensional spaces** (4D+ and 4D-) emerge from origin, each containing complete geometric structure                |
| Observers on either side would perceive their direction as "forward"                                                    | Observers in either dimensional space would perceive their tetrahedron as the "base" form                                |

**Platonia and Shape Space:**

Barbour describes a "configuration space" he calls **Platonia** — populated by all possible "Nows," where each Now is a complete, timeless arrangement of the universe. The Janus Point is the unique configuration of minimal complexity from which all other configurations emanate.

In Quadray geometry, we have an analogous structure:

- **Shape Space**: The space of all possible mass-weighted shapes, providing a scale-free framework
- **Origin as Janus Point**: The unique point [0,0,0,0] where the "dilatational momentum vanishes" (in Barbour's terminology)
- **Complexity measure**: Barbour's "entaxy" (inverse of entropy) increases away from the Janus Point; similarly, the "positive-ness" of Quadray coordinates increases away from origin

**The Geometric Arrow of Time:**

Barbour argues that **complexity growth** (not entropy increase) defines the arrow of time. His collaborators Koslowski and Mercati identified a "gravitational arrow of time" in 2014, showing that gravitational systems naturally evolve toward greater structure.

This aligns with our observation that:

- The tetrahedron at origin (all vertices collapsing to [0,0,0,0]) represents **minimal structure**
- Both the positive tetrahedron (expanding outward) and negative tetrahedron (expanding inward) represent **increasing structure** away from origin
- The origin is not a "dead end" but a **generative point** from which geometric complexity emerges in both directions

**Relational vs. Absolute Space:**

Barbour, following Leibniz and Mach, argues there is no absolute space — only **geometric relationships between things**. This is precisely what Quadray coordinates capture:

- No privileged "up/down" or "x/y/z" axes
- Only the **tetrahedral relationships** between the four basis vectors
- Origin is defined relationally (where all four directions cancel) not absolutely

**Cosmological Implications:**

If black holes are dimensional transition points (as suggested in our conjecture), and if origin represents a Janus Point between 4D+ and 4D- spaces, then:

1. **Matter entering a black hole** doesn't "disappear" — it transitions through the dimensional Janus Point into negative dimensional space
2. **White holes** (the theoretical time-reverse of black holes) represent matter re-emerging from negative to positive dimensional space
3. **The information paradox** is resolved: information is preserved through inversion, existing in the "mirror" dimensional space
4. **The universe's fate** is not heat death (maximum entropy) but continued complexity growth in both temporal/dimensional directions

This framework suggests that what we call the "Big Bang" may be the cosmological Janus Point — not a beginning, but a **pivot** between two "half-universes" each experiencing its own arrow of time pointed away from the central origin.

**Cyclic Extension: The Trogoautoegocrat and Cosmic Breath**

While Barbour's Janus Point describes a single pivot from which two temporal directions emerge, ancient cosmological traditions suggest this process may be **cyclic** — the universe repeatedly passing through origin in an eternal rhythm of expansion, collapse, and re-emergence.

**Gurdjieff's Trogoautoegocrat ("The Universe Eats Itself"):**

G.I. Gurdjieff described the cosmos as governed by the "Most Great Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat" — the Law of Reciprocal Maintenance. The term derives from Greek: _Trogo_ (eat) + _Auto_ (self) + _Ego_ (I) + _Crat_ (rule). In this framework:

- The universe is an **unending chain of systems bound by universal interdependence**
- Every level of existence simultaneously **feeds and is fed upon** — there are no closed systems
- This reciprocal exchange creates a "cosmic perpetual motion machine" that escapes entropy
- The Ouroboros (serpent eating its tail) symbolizes this self-sustaining cosmic process

| Universe as self-consuming/self-generating loop               | Tetrahedron inverts through origin, re-emerges as dual |
| Energy flows both "up" and "down" the cosmic hierarchy        | Structure exists in both 4D+ and 4D- spaces            |
| No ultimate beginning or end — eternal reciprocal maintenance | Origin is not terminus but **transition point**        |
| The "bootstrap" principle — universe is self-consistent loop  | Positive and negative tetrahedra are mutually defining |

**The Breath of Brahma (Hindu Cosmology):**

The Vedic tradition describes cosmic time as the **breath of Vishnu**:

- When Vishnu **exhales**, thousands of universes emerge — each with its own Brahma (creator)
- When Vishnu **inhales**, all universes are reabsorbed — Brahma dies, creation dissolves
- This cycle is **non-ending and eternal** — a "Maha Kalpa" spanning 311 trillion years
- Within each breath, the universe passes through four Yugas (ages), currently in Kali Yuga

Carl Sagan observed: _"The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an innate, number of deaths and rebirths... Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long."_

| Vedic Cosmic Breath              | Quadray Cyclic Model                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exhale** (Srishti/Creation)    | Expansion from origin into 4D+ space               |
| **Inhale** (Pralaya/Dissolution) | Collapse through origin into 4D- space             |
| **Pause** (Janus Point)          | Origin [0,0,0,0] — the moment of minimal extension |
| **Re-exhale**                    | Re-emergence from 4D- back through origin to 4D+   |

**Synthesis: The Cyclic Janus Point**

Combining Barbour's physics with these ancient cosmologies suggests a richer model:

1. **Barbour's Janus Point** describes a _single_ pivot — the Big Bang as midpoint, not beginning
2. **Gurdjieff's Trogoautoegocrat** adds _reciprocity_ — the universe is self-sustaining through mutual exchange
3. **Vedic Cosmic Breath** adds _cyclicity_ — the pivot is passed through repeatedly, eternally

In Quadray terms, this becomes:

```
    4D+ (Positive Space)          4D- (Negative Space)
           ↑                              ↑
    Expansion/Exhale              Expansion/Exhale
           ↑                              ↑
    ═══════╪═══════ ORIGIN [0,0,0,0] ═══════╪═══════
           ↓                              ↓
    Collapse/Inhale               Collapse/Inhale
           ↓                              ↓
    4D- (Negative Space)          4D+ (Positive Space)
```

The tetrahedron doesn't simply invert once — it **breathes** through origin eternally, each passage through the Janus Point constituting a cosmic "death and rebirth." The positive and negative dimensional spaces are not static destinations but phases in an endless oscillation.

**Implications:**

- **Time** is not a line (beginning → end) but a **breath** (expansion ↔ contraction)
- **Black holes** may be local "inhalation points" where matter transitions through dimensional Janus Points
- **The Big Bang** was not _the_ beginning but _a_ passage through origin — one breath among infinite breaths
- **Heat death** is avoided through cyclic regeneration — complexity grows, collapses, and re-emerges

**Vertices (Raw Negative Form):**

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Description  |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------ |
| V₀'    | (-1, 0, 0, 0)        | Inverse of W |
| V₁'    | (0, -1, 0, 0)        | Inverse of X |
| V₂'    | (0, 0, -1, 0)        | Inverse of Y |
| V₃'    | (0, 0, 0, -1)        | Inverse of Z |

### 4.2 Positive Form (Re-normalized)

To satisfy the "all-positive" Quadray convention, add (1, 1, 1, 1) to each vertex:

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Description              |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| V₀'    | (0, 1, 1, 1)         | Three active, W inactive |
| V₁'    | (1, 0, 1, 1)         | Three active, X inactive |
| V₂'    | (1, 1, 0, 1)         | Three active, Y inactive |
| V₃'    | (1, 1, 1, 0)         | Three active, Z inactive |

**Key Insight:** The dual tetrahedron vertices are characterized by having **three** coordinates active (value 1) and **one** coordinate inactive (value 0) — the inverse pattern of the base tetrahedron.

### 4.3 Stella Octangula

When both tetrahedra are overlaid (base + dual), they form the **stella octangula** — a compound of two tetrahedra that circumscribes an octahedron and is circumscribed by a cube.

## 5. Negative Dimensionality

### 5.1 Fuller's Critique of "Up" and "Down"

R. Buckminster Fuller criticized the human language conventions of "Up" and "Down" as artifacts of flat-earth thinking. On a spherical planet (Earth), these directions are arbitrary and locally-dependent — what is "up" in Toronto is "down" in Sydney.

**The Universal Directions:**

Fuller recognized that the only absolute directions relative to any center of gravity are **IN** and **OUT**:

| Convention       | Problem                      | Reality                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "Up" / "Down"    | Arbitrary, locally-dependent | Flat-earth mental model  |
| **"Out" / "In"** | Absolute, universal          | Spherical/radial reality |

### 5.2 Directional Interpretation

By extension, we map these universal directions to coordinate signs:

| Sign             | Direction | Interpretation                            |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **+** (Positive) | **OUT**   | Expansion away from origin/center         |
| **-** (Negative) | **IN**    | Collapse toward and through origin/center |

This is not merely a convention — it reflects the fundamental nature of radial geometry:

- **OUT (+)** = Radiation, expansion, divergence from center
- **IN (-)** = Gravitation, contraction, convergence toward center
- Einstein stated that "Gravity is a response to Geometry", we believe this is what he meant, where Space inherently contains these properties

### 5.3 Negative Dimensional Space

A tetrahedron with all-negative coordinates defines a tetrahedron in what we term **negative dimensional space**, so that we have a 4D+ and 4D- pair of dimensions:

```
Base Tetrahedron (+):     Dual Tetrahedron (-):

    Expands outward           Collapses inward
    from origin               through origin

        W (+)                     W (-)
        ↗                          ↙
       /                            \
      ●───────→ X (+)    X (-) ←───────●
       \                            /
        ↘                          ↗
        Y (+)                     Y (-)
```

**Conceptual Model:**

- The **positive tetrahedron** expands outward from the origin into positive dimensional space
- The **negative tetrahedron** is the same "size" but has collapsed through the origin into negative dimensionality
- The origin (0, 0, 0, 0) is the boundary between positive and negative dimensional spaces
- This mirrors the relationship between matter and antimatter, or expansion and contraction

### 5.4 Mathematical Formalization

For any point P = (w, x, y, z):

- **P > 0** (all positive): Point exists in positive dimensional space
- **P < 0** (all negative): Point exists in negative dimensional space
- **Mixed signs**: Point spans the dimensional boundary

The dual tetrahedron's re-normalized form (0,1,1,1), (1,0,1,1), etc. represents the negative tetrahedron **projected back** into positive coordinate space through additive translation.

## 6. The Unit Cube in Quadray Space

### 6.1 The `halfSize` Convention

In ARTexplorer, all polyhedra are parameterized using the **`halfSize`** convention, which defines the base unit for positioning vertices at origin:

**Definition:**

```javascript
// From rt-polyhedra.js
const s = halfSize; // Default = 1
// Cube vertices at (±s, ±s, ±s) in Cartesian
```

**Geometric Relationships:**

| Parameter            | Value     | Description                                |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `halfSize`           | s         | Half the cube edge length (cube edge = 2s) |
| Cube edge            | 2s        | Full edge length in Cartesian              |
| Cube diagonal        | 2√3·s     | Body diagonal (corner to opposite corner)  |
| **Tetrahedron edge** | **2√2·s** | Face diagonal of cube (√((2s)² + (2s)²))   |

**The Critical Relationship — Cube and Tetrahedron Share Vertices:**

When a tetrahedron is inscribed in a cube (using alternating vertices), the tetrahedron's edges are the **face diagonals** of the cube, not the cube edges:

```
Cube edge = 2s
Tetrahedron edge = √(2s² + 2s²) = √(8s²) = 2√2·s

For halfSize = 1:
  - Cube edge length = 2
  - Tetrahedron edge length = 2√2 ≈ 2.828
  - Tetrahedron edge quadrance Q = 8  (edge² = (2√2)² = 8)
```

**RT-Pure Edge Quadrance:**

```javascript
// From rt-polyhedra.js tetrahedron definition
const expectedQ = 8 * halfSize * halfSize; // Q = (2√2·s)² = 8s²
```

When `halfSize = 1`:

- Cube vertices at (±1, ±1, ±1) — total 8 vertices
- Tetrahedron uses 4 alternating vertices: (-1,-1,-1), (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1)
- Each tetrahedron edge has quadrance Q = 8
- Dual tetrahedron uses the other 4 vertices: (+1,+1,+1), (-1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,-1)

**Why `halfSize` Instead of Full Size?**

The `halfSize` convention ensures:

1. **Origin-centered geometry**: All polyhedra are centered at [0,0,0,0]
2. **Symmetric coordinates**: Vertices have balanced ± values
3. **Direct Quadray conversion**: The pattern {2,1,1,0} scaled by `halfSize` maps directly to (±s,±s,±s)

### 6.2 Cube Vertices in Quadray Space

The cube vertices are formed by combinations of **two active coordinates**. In Quadray space, the cube is described by permutations of the pattern {2, 1, 1, 0}:

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian Equivalent |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| C₀     | (2, 1, 1, 0)         | (+s, +s, +s)         |
| C₁     | (2, 1, 0, 1)         | (+s, +s, -s)         |
| C₂     | (2, 0, 1, 1)         | (+s, -s, +s)         |
| C₃     | (0, 2, 1, 1)         | (+s, -s, -s)         |
| C₄     | (1, 2, 1, 0)         | (-s, +s, +s)         |
| C₅     | (1, 2, 0, 1)         | (-s, +s, -s)         |
| C₆     | (1, 0, 2, 1)         | (-s, -s, +s)         |
| C₇     | (0, 1, 2, 1)         | (-s, -s, -s)         |

### 6.3 Pattern Analysis

- Each vertex has one coordinate = 2, two coordinates = 1, one coordinate = 0
- The coordinate with value 2 indicates the "dominant" quadray direction
- The coordinate with value 0 indicates the "absent" quadray direction

### 6.4 Relationship to Tetrahedra

- The base tetrahedron uses 4 of these 8 cube vertices (alternating corners)
- The dual tetrahedron uses the other 4 cube vertices
- Together they form the stella octangula inscribed in the cube

**Vertex Assignment (halfSize = 1):**

| Vertex     | Cube Position | Quadray   | Tetrahedron |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| (-1,-1,-1) | C₇            | (0,1,2,1) | **Base** T₀ |
| (+1,+1,-1) | C₁            | (2,1,0,1) | **Base** T₁ |
| (+1,-1,+1) | C₂            | (2,0,1,1) | **Base** T₂ |
| (-1,+1,+1) | C₄            | (1,2,1,0) | **Base** T₃ |
| (+1,+1,+1) | C₀            | (2,1,1,0) | **Dual** D₀ |
| (-1,-1,+1) | C₆            | (1,0,2,1) | **Dual** D₁ |
| (-1,+1,-1) | C₅            | (1,2,0,1) | **Dual** D₂ |
| (+1,-1,-1) | C₃            | (0,2,1,1) | **Dual** D₃ |

---

## 7. The Octahedron in Quadray Space

The octahedron has the simplest representation in Quadray space — its 6 vertices are the **permutations of {1, 1, 0, 0}**:

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian Equivalent |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| O₀     | (1, 1, 0, 0)         | (+s, 0, 0)           |
| O₁     | (1, 0, 1, 0)         | (0, +s, 0)           |
| O₂     | (1, 0, 0, 1)         | (0, 0, +s)           |
| O₃     | (0, 1, 1, 0)         | (-s, 0, 0)           |
| O₄     | (0, 1, 0, 1)         | (0, -s, 0)           |
| O₅     | (0, 0, 1, 1)         | (0, 0, -s)           |

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Each vertex has exactly two coordinates = 1, two coordinates = 0
- This creates 6 vertices (C(4,2) = 6 combinations)
- The octahedron is the "edge figure" of the tetrahedron in Quadray space

**Significance:**

- The octahedron vertices correspond to the **edge midpoints** of the unit tetrahedra
- In Fuller's IVM (Isotropic Vector Matrix), the octahedron is central to space-filling
- The cuboctahedron (Vector Equilibrium) has its 12 vertices at octahedral positions

## 8. Complete Polyhedra Reference in Quadray Coordinates

This section provides a comprehensive reference for all base polyhedra expressed in Quadray (WXYZ) coordinates. Each form is presented with its vertex coordinates, coordinate patterns, and relationships to other polyhedra.

### 8.1 Summary Table: Polyhedra Coordinate Patterns

| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Tetrahedron**          | 4        | (1,0,0,0) perms     | 1             | Single active                |

| **Dodecahedron**         | 20       | φ-based mixed       | —             | Dual of icosahedron          |
| **Cuboctahedron**        | 12       | (1,1,0,0) scaled    | 2             | Vector Equilibrium           |
| **Rhombic Dodecahedron** | 14       | Mixed axis + octant | —             | Dual of cuboctahedron        |

### 8.2 Tetrahedron (Revisited)

The **fundamental unit** of Quadray space. All other polyhedra can be understood in relation to the tetrahedron.

**Vertices (4):**
| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Pattern |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| T₀ | (1, 0, 0, 0) | W only |
| T₁ | (0, 1, 0, 0) | X only |
| T₂ | (0, 0, 1, 0) | Y only |
| T₃ | (0, 0, 0, 1) | Z only |

**Edges (6):** All pairs of vertices
**Faces (4):** Equilateral triangles
**Schläfli Symbol:** {3, 3}

**Quadray Insight:** The tetrahedron vertices ARE the basis vectors themselves — the most natural polyhedron in this coordinate system.

### 8.3 Dual Tetrahedron

The **inverted** tetrahedron, rotated 180° through the origin.

**Vertices (4) — Positive Normalized Form:**
| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Pattern |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| D₀ | (0, 1, 1, 1) | W absent |
| D₁ | (1, 0, 1, 1) | X absent |
| D₂ | (1, 1, 0, 1) | Y absent |
| D₃ | (1, 1, 1, 0) | Z absent |

**Relationship to Base Tetrahedron:**

- Negative form: (-1,0,0,0), (0,-1,0,0), etc. (IN direction)
- Re-normalized by adding (1,1,1,1) to each vertex
- Combined with base tetrahedron forms the **Stella Octangula**

### 8.4 Cube (Hexahedron)

The cube emerges from combining both tetrahedra — its 8 vertices are the union of tetrahedron and dual tetrahedron vertices when properly scaled.

**Vertices (8):**
| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian | Octant |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| C₀ | (2, 1, 1, 0) | (+,+,+) | +++ |
| C₁ | (2, 1, 0, 1) | (+,+,-) | ++- |
| C₂ | (2, 0, 1, 1) | (+,-,+) | +-+ |
| C₃ | (1, 2, 1, 0) | (-,+,+) | -++ |
| C₄ | (1, 2, 0, 1) | (-,+,-) | -+- |
| C₅ | (1, 0, 2, 1) | (-,-,+) | --+ |
| C₆ | (0, 2, 1, 1) | (+,-,-) | +-- |
| C₇ | (0, 1, 2, 1) | (-,-,-) | --- |

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Each vertex: one coord = 2, two coords = 1, one coord = 0
- The "2" indicates the dominant quadray direction
- The "0" indicates the absent quadray direction
- Sum of coordinates = 4 for all vertices (consistent normalization)

**Edges (12):** Connect vertices differing in exactly one "dominant" position
**Faces (6):** Squares
**Schläfli Symbol:** {4, 3}

**Tetrahedra Inside Cube:**

- Base tetrahedron: vertices C₀, C₄, C₅, C₆ (alternating corners)
- Dual tetrahedron: vertices C₁, C₂, C₃, C₇ (other alternating corners)

### 8.5 Octahedron

The octahedron vertices lie at the **edge midpoints** of the tetrahedra, making it central to the IVM lattice structure.

**Vertices (6):**
| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian Axis | Pattern |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| O₀ | (1, 1, 0, 0) | +X | WX pair |
| O₁ | (1, 0, 1, 0) | +Y | WY pair |
| O₂ | (1, 0, 0, 1) | +Z | WZ pair |
| O₃ | (0, 1, 1, 0) | -X | XY pair |
| O₄ | (0, 1, 0, 1) | -Y | XZ pair |
| O₅ | (0, 0, 1, 1) | -Z | YZ pair |

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Each vertex: exactly two coords = 1, two coords = 0
- C(4,2) = 6 combinations = 6 vertices
- Sum of coordinates = 2 for all vertices

**Edges (12):** Connect vertices sharing exactly one active coordinate
**Faces (8):** Equilateral triangles
**Schläfli Symbol:** {3, 4}

**Dual Relationship:** The octahedron is dual to the cube

### 8.6 Icosahedron

The icosahedron requires **golden ratio (φ)** relationships, introducing irrational coordinates that are nonetheless expressible in Quadray form.

**Cartesian Construction (for reference):**
Vertices at cyclic permutations of (0, ±1, ±φ) where φ = (1+√5)/2

**Quadray Vertices (12):**

The icosahedron vertices in Quadray coordinates involve φ-scaled combinations. Using the normalization where φ = (1+√5)/2:

| Vertex | Quadray (approximate) | Cartesian   | Group    |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| I₀     | (φ+1, 1, φ, 0)        | (0, +1, +φ) | YZ-plane |
| I₁     | (φ+1, 1, 0, φ)        | (0, +1, -φ) | YZ-plane |
| I₂     | (1, φ+1, φ, 0)        | (0, -1, +φ) | YZ-plane |
| I₃     | (1, φ+1, 0, φ)        | (0, -1, -φ) | YZ-plane |
| I₄     | (φ, φ+1, 1, 0)        | (+1, 0, +φ) | XZ-plane |
| I₅     | (0, φ+1, 1, φ)        | (-1, 0, +φ) | XZ-plane |
| I₆     | (φ, 1, φ+1, 0)        | (+1, 0, -φ) | XZ-plane |
| I₇     | (0, 1, φ+1, φ)        | (-1, 0, -φ) | XZ-plane |
| I₈     | (φ, 0, φ+1, 1)        | (+φ, +1, 0) | XY-plane |
| I₉     | (φ, φ, 1, φ+1)        | (+φ, -1, 0) | XY-plane |
| I₁₀    | (0, φ, φ+1, 1)        | (-φ, +1, 0) | XY-plane |
| I₁₁    | (0, φ, 1, φ+1)        | (-φ, -1, 0) | XY-plane |

**Note:** Exact Quadray values require symbolic φ representation (PurePhi method).

**Edges (30):** Connect vertices of adjacent golden rectangles
**Faces (20):** Equilateral triangles
**Schläfli Symbol:** {3, 5}

**Golden Ratio in Quadray Space:**

- φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618034
- φ² = φ + 1 (algebraic identity — no multiplication needed!)
- 1/φ = φ - 1 (algebraic identity — no division needed!)

### 8.7 Dodecahedron

The dodecahedron is the **dual of the icosahedron**. Its 20 vertices correspond to the 20 face centers of the icosahedron.

**Cartesian Construction:**

- 8 vertices at cube corners (±s, ±s, ±s)
- 12 vertices at permutations of (0, ±1/φ, ±φ)

**Quadray Vertices (20):**

| Vertex | Quadray (approximate)  | Cartesian        | Type         |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| D₀-D₇  | Cube pattern {2,1,1,0} | (±s,±s,±s)       | Cube corners |
| D₈-D₁₉ | φ-scaled permutations  | (0,±1/φ,±φ) etc. | Phi vertices |

**Cube Corner Vertices (8):**
Same as Section 8.4 cube vertices, scaled appropriately.

**Phi Vertices (12):**
| Vertex | Quadray (approx) | Cartesian |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| D₈ | (1, 1+φ, φ, 0) | (0, +1/φ, +φ) |
| D₉ | (1, 1+φ, 0, φ) | (0, +1/φ, -φ) |
| D₁₀ | (1+φ, 1, φ, 0) | (0, -1/φ, +φ) |
| D₁₁ | (1+φ, 1, 0, φ) | (0, -1/φ, -φ) |
| D₁₂ | (φ, 0, 1+φ, 1) | (+φ, 0, +1/φ) |
| D₁₃ | (0, φ, 1+φ, 1) | (-φ, 0, +1/φ) |
| D₁₄ | (φ, 0, 1, 1+φ) | (+φ, 0, -1/φ) |
| D₁₅ | (0, φ, 1, 1+φ) | (-φ, 0, -1/φ) |
| D₁₆ | (1+φ, φ, 1, 0) | (+1/φ, +φ, 0) |
| D₁₇ | (1, φ, 1+φ, 0) | (+1/φ, -φ, 0) |
| D₁₈ | (1+φ, 0, 1, φ) | (-1/φ, +φ, 0) |
| D₁₉ | (1, 0, 1+φ, φ) | (-1/φ, -φ, 0) |

**Edges (30):** Connect cube corners to phi vertices
**Faces (12):** Regular pentagons
**Schläfli Symbol:** {5, 3}

### 8.8 Cuboctahedron (Vector Equilibrium)

Fuller's **Vector Equilibrium (VE)** — the only polyhedron where all vertices are equidistant from the center AND from each other. Central to the IVM lattice.

**Cartesian Construction:**
Vertices at permutations of (±1, ±1, 0) scaled by s/√2

**Quadray Vertices (12):**

The cuboctahedron vertices are **scaled octahedron vertices** positioned at edge midpoints of both cube and octahedron.

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian   | Plane |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| VE₀    | (1, 1, 0, 0) × k     | (+t, +t, 0) | XY    |
| VE₁    | (1, 0, 1, 0) × k     | (+t, 0, +t) | XZ    |
| VE₂    | (1, 0, 0, 1) × k     | (0, +t, +t) | YZ    |
| VE₃    | (0, 1, 1, 0) × k     | (-t, +t, 0) | XY    |
| VE₄    | (0, 1, 0, 1) × k     | (+t, -t, 0) | XY    |
| VE₅    | (0, 0, 1, 1) × k     | (-t, -t, 0) | XY    |
| VE₆    | (1, 1, 0, 0) × k'    | (+t, 0, -t) | XZ    |
| VE₇    | (1, 0, 1, 0) × k'    | (-t, 0, +t) | XZ    |
| VE₈    | (1, 0, 0, 1) × k'    | (0, +t, -t) | YZ    |
| VE₉    | (0, 1, 1, 0) × k'    | (-t, 0, -t) | XZ    |
| VE₁₀   | (0, 1, 0, 1) × k'    | (0, -t, +t) | YZ    |
| VE₁₁   | (0, 0, 1, 1) × k'    | (0, -t, -t) | YZ    |

Where t = s/√2 (edge midpoint distance from origin)

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Same (1,1,0,0) pattern as octahedron
- Scaled to lie at cube/octahedron edge midpoints
- 12 vertices = C(4,2) × 2 orientations

**Edges (24):** All equal length
**Faces (14):** 8 triangles + 6 squares
**Schläfli Symbol:** Not Platonic (Archimedean)

**Significance:**

- All 12 radii from center to vertices are EQUAL
- All 24 edges are EQUAL to the radii
- This is the "jitterbug" equilibrium point in Fuller's transformational geometry

### 8.9 Rhombic Dodecahedron

The **dual of the cuboctahedron** — its 14 vertices are the face centers of the cuboctahedron (6 squares + 8 triangles).

**Quadray Vertices (14):**

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Cartesian  | Type       | Degree |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| R₀     | (t, 0, 0, 0) norm    | (+t, 0, 0) | +X axis    | 4      |
| R₁     | (0, t, 0, 0) norm    | (-t, 0, 0) | -X axis    | 4      |
| R₂     | (0, 0, t, 0) norm    | (0, +t, 0) | +Y axis    | 4      |
| R₃     | (0, 0, 0, t) norm    | (0, -t, 0) | -Y axis    | 4      |
| R₄     | scaled W             | (0, 0, +t) | +Z axis    | 4      |
| R₅     | scaled -W            | (0, 0, -t) | -Z axis    | 4      |
| R₆     | (u, u, u, 0) norm    | (+u,+u,+u) | +++ octant | 3      |
| R₇     | (u, u, 0, u) norm    | (+u,+u,-u) | ++- octant | 3      |
| R₈     | (u, 0, u, u) norm    | (+u,-u,+u) | +-+ octant | 3      |
| R₉     | (0, u, u, u) norm    | (+u,-u,-u) | +-- octant | 3      |
| R₁₀    | (u, u, u, 0)'        | (-u,+u,+u) | -++ octant | 3      |
| R₁₁    | (u, u, 0, u)'        | (-u,+u,-u) | -+- octant | 3      |
| R₁₂    | (u, 0, u, u)'        | (-u,-u,+u) | --+ octant | 3      |
| R₁₃    | (0, u, u, u)'        | (-u,-u,-u) | --- octant | 3      |

Where:

- t = s/√2 (cuboctahedron vertex distance)
- u = t/2 = s/(2√2) (octant vertex distance for planar rhombic faces)

**Vertex Types:**

- **6 axis vertices** (degree 4): At square face centers of cuboctahedron
- **8 octant vertices** (degree 3): At triangle face centers of cuboctahedron

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Axis vertices: lie on coordinate axes at distance t
- Octant vertices: lie on body diagonals at distance u = t/2
- The u = t/2 relationship ensures **planar rhombic faces** (critical!)

**Edges (24):** Connect axis vertices to adjacent octant vertices
**Faces (12):** Rhombi (diamond shapes)
**Schläfli Symbol:** Not Platonic (Catalan solid)

**IVM Significance:**
The rhombic dodecahedron is the **most relevant single form** for IVM spatial representation because:

- All 14 vertices fall exactly on IVM grid intersections
- It is the Voronoi cell of the FCC (face-centered cubic) lattice
- It tiles 3D space with no gaps (space-filling)

## 8.11 Integer Quadray Lattice Positions (IVM Sphere Packing)

**Key Insight from Kirby Urner (January 2026):**

> "Given how I've calibrated quadrays, from (0,0,0,0) the 12 surrounding ball centers at the corners of a cuboctahedron are all unique permutations of {2,1,1,0} as in (2,1,0,1) (0,2,1,1) (1,2,0,1) and so on — 12 possibilities."

This reveals a beautiful pattern: the fundamental polyhedra of the IVM (Isotropic Vector Matrix) lattice can be expressed as **pure positive integer Quadray coordinates** — no scaling factors, no √2, no φ. This is the native language of closest sphere packing.

### The Integer Quadray Progression

| Polyhedron           | Quadray Pattern    | # Permutations | Sum | IVM Role                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | --- | -------------------------- |
| **Tetrahedron**      | {1, 0, 0, 0}       | 4              | 1   | Fundamental unit           |
| **Octahedron**       | {1, 1, 0, 0}       | 6              | 2   | Edge midpoints             |
| **Dual Tetrahedron** | {0, 1, 1, 1}       | 4              | 3   | Inverted fundamental       |
| **Cuboctahedron**    | {2, 1, 1, 0}       | 12             | 4   | 12-around-1 sphere packing |
| **Cube**             | {2, 1, 1, 0} perms | 8 (subset)     | 4   | Alternating corners        |

### The 12 Cuboctahedron Vertices

All unique permutations of {2, 1, 1, 0}:

| Vertex | Quadray (W, X, Y, Z) | Sum | Cartesian Direction |
| ------ | -------------------- | --- | ------------------- |
| VE₀    | (2, 1, 1, 0)         | 4   | (+,+,0) region      |
| VE₁    | (2, 1, 0, 1)         | 4   | (+,0,+) region      |
| VE₂    | (2, 0, 1, 1)         | 4   | (0,+,+) region      |
| VE₃    | (1, 2, 1, 0)         | 4   | (+,+,0) region      |
| VE₄    | (1, 2, 0, 1)         | 4   | (+,0,-) region      |
| VE₅    | (1, 1, 2, 0)         | 4   | (+,-,0) region      |
| VE₆    | (1, 1, 0, 2)         | 4   | (0,+,-) region      |
| VE₇    | (1, 0, 2, 1)         | 4   | (-,+,0) region      |
| VE₈    | (1, 0, 1, 2)         | 4   | (0,-,+) region      |
| VE₉    | (0, 2, 1, 1)         | 4   | (-,0,+) region      |
| VE₁₀   | (0, 1, 2, 1)         | 4   | (-,-,0) region      |
| VE₁₁   | (0, 1, 1, 2)         | 4   | (0,-,-) region      |

**Combinatorial Verification:** C(4,1) × C(3,2) = 4 × 3 = 12 ✓

The "2" can be in any of 4 positions (W, X, Y, or Z), and the "0" can be in any of the remaining 3 positions. The two "1"s fill the remaining slots.

### Physical Interpretation: 12-Around-1 Sphere Packing

In closest sphere packing, when you place a sphere at the origin, exactly **12 spheres** can touch it simultaneously. The centers of these 12 touching spheres form a cuboctahedron (Vector Equilibrium).

```
Central sphere: (0, 0, 0, 0)
12 touching spheres: all permutations of {2, 1, 1, 0}
```

The integer "2" represents moving 2 units along one Quadray axis — exactly the distance to the next sphere center in the IVM lattice. The combination {2, 1, 1, 0} encodes the tetrahedral close-packing relationship directly.

### The Janus Extension: Negative Cuboctahedron

Following our 4D± framework, the **negative cuboctahedron** exists in 4D⁻ space:

| Positive (4D⁺)     | Negative (4D⁻)        | Relationship            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| {2, 1, 1, 0} perms | {-2, -1, -1, 0} perms | Janus inversion         |
| Sum = 4            | Sum = -4              | Sign-inverted           |
| 12 vertices        | 12 vertices           | Mirrored through origin |

The negative cuboctahedron represents the "inside-out" VE — a Vector Equilibrium that has passed through the geometric Janus Point at origin.

### Why Integer Coordinates Matter

1. **Exact Arithmetic:** No floating-point errors accumulate in lattice calculations
2. **Natural Discretization:** The IVM is inherently discrete; integer Quadrays honor this
3. **Combinatorial Clarity:** Vertex counts are simply permutation counts
4. **Fuller's Vision Realized:** "The coordinate system Universe is actually using"

### Implementation: Native Quadray Demonstrators

ARTexplorer implements these as "Quadray Demonstrators" that define geometry in native WXYZ coordinates, converting to XYZ only at the GPU boundary:

- `quadrayTetrahedron` — {1, 0, 0, 0} permutations
- `quadrayDualTetrahedron` — {0, 1, 1, 1} permutations
- `quadrayCuboctahedron` — {2, 1, 1, 0} permutations (Kirby's calibration)

These demonstrators preserve the integer Quadray coordinates in metadata, allowing inspection of the native representation alongside the rendered Cartesian form.

## 9. Conversion Between Quadray and Cartesian

### 9.1 Quadray to Cartesian

Given Quadray coordinates (w, x, y, z):

**Step 1: Zero-Sum Normalization**

```
mean = (w + x + y + z) / 4
w' = w - mean
x' = x - mean
y' = y - mean
z' = z - mean
```

**Step 2: Linear Combination with Basis Vectors**

```javascript
// Basis vectors (Z-up convention)
W_basis = (+1, +1, +1) / √3
X_basis = (+1, -1, -1) / √3
Y_basis = (-1, +1, -1) / √3
Z_basis = (-1, -1, +1) / √3

// Cartesian result
cartesian = w' * W_basis + x' * X_basis + y' * Y_basis + z' * Z_basis
```

### 9.2 Cartesian to Quadray

Given Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z):

```javascript
// Dot product with each basis vector
w = (x + y + z) / √3
x = (x - y - z) / √3
y = (-x + y - z) / √3
z = (-x - y + z) / √3

// Normalize to all-positive (optional)
min_val = min(w, x, y, z)
if (min_val < 0) {
  w -= min_val
  x -= min_val
  y -= min_val
  z -= min_val
}
```

### 9.3 Tom Ace's Implementation Reference

See: http://minortriad.com/quadray.html (C++ implementation)

Key insight: The conversion exploits the fact that "planar simplicial coordinates work like Cartesian 3-space coordinates projected onto the plane x+y+z=0."

## 10. RT-Pure Operations in Quadray Space

This section documents RT-pure (Rational Trigonometry) methods for performing geometric operations directly in Quadray space, based on Tom Ace's C++ implementation but rationalized to eliminate classical trigonometric functions.

### 10.1 The Tetrahedral Metric Tensor

In Quadray space, distances and quadrances require a **metric tensor** because the basis vectors are not orthonormal. The scaling factor `4/3` appears throughout due to the tetrahedral geometry.

**Quadrance Scaling Factor:**

```
Q_quadray = Q_cartesian × (4/3)
```

This factor arises from the tetrahedral angle relationship:

- Basis vectors meet at spread s = 8/9 (tetrahedral angle)
- The metric tensor compensates for non-orthogonal basis

### 10.2 Quadrance (Distance²) in Quadray Space

**RT-Pure Quadrance from Origin:**

Given a Quadray point P = (a, b, c, d):

```javascript
// Step 1: Zero-sum normalize
const mean = (a + b + c + d) / 4;
const normalized = [a - mean, b - mean, c - mean, d - mean];

// Step 2: Compute quadrance (sum of squares)
let Q = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  Q += normalized[i] * normalized[i];
}

// Step 3: Apply metric scaling
const quadrance = Q * (4 / 3); // Metric tensor scaling

// Note: Distance = √quadrance (defer √ to GPU boundary)
```

**RT-Pure Quadrance Between Two Points:**

Given P1 = (a1, b1, c1, d1) and P2 = (a2, b2, c2, d2):

```javascript
// Step 1: Zero-sum normalize both points
const norm1 = zeroSumNormalize([a1, b1, c1, d1]);
const norm2 = zeroSumNormalize([a2, b2, c2, d2]);

// Step 2: Compute difference quadrance
let Q = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  const delta = norm1[i] - norm2[i];
  Q += delta * delta;
}

// Step 3: Apply metric scaling
const quadrance = Q * (4 / 3);
```

### 10.3 Dot Product in Quadray Space

**RT-Pure Dot Product:**

The dot product of two Quadray vectors follows the same pattern:

```javascript
function quadrayDotProduct(P, Q) {
  // Step 1: Zero-sum normalize both vectors
  const normP = zeroSumNormalize(P);
  const normQ = zeroSumNormalize(Q);

  // Step 2: Compute standard dot product
  let dot = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    dot += normP[i] * normQ[i];
  }

  // Step 3: Apply metric scaling
  return dot * (4 / 3);
}
```

**Spread from Dot Product (RT-Pure):**

```javascript
// Spread s = 1 - (dot²) / (Q_P × Q_Q)
// This replaces sin²(θ) without transcendental functions!
function quadraySpread(P, Q) {
  const dot = quadrayDotProduct(P, Q);
  const Q_P = quadrayQuadrance(P);
  const Q_Q = quadrayQuadrance(Q);

  return 1 - (dot * dot) / (Q_P * Q_Q);
}
```

### 10.4 Cross Product in Quadray Space

Tom Ace's cross product formula uses a 4×4 determinant with basis vectors in the top row:

```
|  W       X       Y       Z      |
|  k       k       k       k      |
|  P.a     P.b     P.c     P.d    |
|  Q.a     Q.b     Q.c     Q.d    |
```

Where k = √3/3 (scaling constant).

**RT-Pure Cross Product (deferred √):**

```javascript
function quadrayCrossProduct(P, Q) {
  // k² = 1/3 (work in quadrance space, defer √3)
  const k = Math.sqrt(3) / 3; // Only √ at final step

  const result = [0, 0, 0, 0];

  // Laplace expansion along top row (basis vectors)
  result[0] =
    k *
    (P[2] * Q[3] -
      P[3] * Q[2] +
      P[3] * Q[1] -
      P[1] * Q[3] +
      P[1] * Q[2] -
      P[2] * Q[1]);
  result[1] =
    k *
    (P[3] * Q[2] -
      P[2] * Q[3] +
      P[0] * Q[3] -
      P[3] * Q[0] +
      P[2] * Q[0] -
      P[0] * Q[2]);
  result[2] =
    k *
    (P[0] * Q[1] -
      P[1] * Q[0] +
      P[3] * Q[0] -
      P[0] * Q[3] +
      P[1] * Q[3] -
      P[3] * Q[1]);
  result[3] =
    k *
    (P[2] * Q[1] -
      P[1] * Q[2] +
      P[0] * Q[2] -
      P[2] * Q[0] +
      P[1] * Q[0] -
      P[0] * Q[1]);

  return result;
}
```

### 10.5 RT-Pure Rotation in Quadray Space

Tom Ace's original rotation formula uses classical trigonometry:

```
F = (2·cos(θ) + 1) / 3
G = (2·cos(θ - 120°) + 1) / 3
H = (2·cos(θ + 120°) + 1) / 3
```

**RT-Pure Rotation Using Spread:**

We rationalize this using N.J. Wildberger's spread/cross formulas:

```javascript
/**
 * RT-Pure rotation coefficients using spread (s) and cross (c)
 *
 * Spread s = sin²(θ)  (rational, no transcendentals)
 * Cross c = cos²(θ) = 1 - s  (complementary)
 *
 * For rotation by spread s about the W-axis:
 */
function rotationCoeffsFromSpread(s) {
  // cos(θ) from spread: cos²(θ) = 1 - s, so cos(θ) = ±√(1-s)
  // Sign determined by quadrant (spread doesn't distinguish)
  const cosTheta = Math.sqrt(1 - s); // Deferred √

  // F, G, H from cos identities (rationalized)
  // cos(θ - 120°) = cos(θ)·cos(120°) + sin(θ)·sin(120°)
  //               = cos(θ)·(-1/2) + sin(θ)·(√3/2)
  // Similarly for θ + 120°

  const sinTheta = Math.sqrt(s); // sin(θ) = √spread
  const cos120 = -0.5; // Exact rational: -1/2
  const sin120 = Math.sqrt(0.75); // √(3/4) - deferred

**Exact Integer Spread Rotations (Gold Standard):**

For certain special angles, spread and cross are exact rationals:

| Rotation | Spread (s) | Cross (c) | Notes                      |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| 0°       | 0          | 1         | Identity                   |
| 30°      | 1/4        | 3/4       | —                          |
| 45°      | 1/2        | 1/2       | Exact!                     |
| 60°      | 3/4        | 1/4       | Equilateral triangle angle |
| 90°      | 1          | 0         | Exact integers!            |
| 120°     | 3/4        | 1/4       | Tetrahedral face angle     |
| 180°     | 0          | 1         | Full inversion             |

**Example: 90° Rotation (s=1, c=0):**

```javascript
// Perfect RT-pure rotation with exact integers
const F = (2 * 0 + 1) / 3 = 1/3;
const G = (2 * (-1/2) + 1) / 3 = 0;
const H = (2 * (-1/2) + 1) / 3 = 0;

// Wait - let's verify with full formula...
// At θ=90°: cos(90°)=0, sin(90°)=1
// F = (2·0 + 1)/3 = 1/3
// G = (2·(0·(-1/2) + 1·(√3/2)) + 1)/3 = (√3 + 1)/3
// H = (2·(0·(-1/2) - 1·(√3/2)) + 1)/3 = (-√3 + 1)/3

// Transformation matrix becomes pure rotation!
```

### 10.6 Weierstrass Circle Parametrization for Rotation

The Weierstrass substitution provides an **algebraic** alternative to classical trigonometry for generating rotation points:

**Classical (Transcendental):**

```
x = cos(θ)
y = sin(θ)
```

**Weierstrass (Algebraic):**

```
t = tan(θ/2)  // Parameter (rational for rational angles)

x = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)
y = 2t / (1 + t²)
```

**RT-Pure Benefits:**

- For any rational t, both x and y are **exact rational values**
- No transcendental functions involved
- Natural connection to spread: s = y² = 4t² / (1 + t²)²

**Implementation in ARTexplorer:**

```javascript
// From rt-math.js - Weierstrass circle parametrization
RT.circleParam = function (t) {
  const t2 = t * t;
  const denom = 1 + t2;

  return {
    x: (1 - t2) / denom, // cos(θ) - algebraic!
    y: (2 * t) / denom, // sin(θ) - algebraic!
  };
};

// Generate rotation points without sin/cos
function generateRotationPoints(segments) {
  const points = [];

  for (let i = 0; i <= segments; i++) {
    // Parameter t traces half-circle as t: -∞ → +∞
    // Use tan approximation for bounded range
    const angle = (Math.PI * i) / segments;
    const t = Math.tan(angle / 2); // Only transcendental here

    const { x, y } = RT.circleParam(t);
    points.push({ x, y });
  }

  return points;
}
```

**Special Rational t-Values:**

| t    | θ    | cos(θ) | sin(θ) | Spread s |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 0    | 0°   | 1      | 0      | 0        |
| 1/√3 | 60°  | 1/2    | √3/2   | 3/4      |
| 1    | 90°  | 0      | 1      | 1        |
| √3   | 120° | -1/2   | √3/2   | 3/4      |
| ∞    | 180° | -1     | 0      | 0        |

### 10.7 Application: Section Node Circles (Papercut Module)

The Weierstrass parametrization is used in the Papercut module for generating section node circles at cutplane intersections:

```javascript
// From rt-papercut.js - RT-pure circle generation
const segments = state.adaptiveNodeResolution ? 64 : 32;

const circlePoints = [];
for (let i = 0; i <= segments; i++) {
  // Weierstrass parameter
  const t = Math.tan((Math.PI * i) / segments);
  const point = RT.circleParam(t);

  circlePoints.push(
    new THREE.Vector3(
      center.x + radius * point.x,
      center.y + radius * point.y,
      cutplaneZ
    )
  );
}
```

**Advantages over Classical Approach:**

- Algebraic computation until final Vector3 creation
- Exact rational coordinates for many common segment counts
- Educational demonstration of RT principles

## 11. Implementation Notes

### 11.1 Current ARTexplorer Implementation

The current implementation in `rt-math.js` uses coordinate **translation** rather than native Quadray calculation:

```javascript
// Current approach (Theatre - see DEV-PRIVATE.md §7.2.1)
Quadray.toCartesian = (a, b, c, d, THREE) => {
  const normalized = Quadray.zeroSumNormalize([a, b, c, d]);
  const result = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    result.add(Quadray.basisVectors[i].clone().multiplyScalar(normalized[i]));
  }
  return result; // Back to XYZ immediately
};
```

### 11.2 Future: True WXYZ-Native Calculation

For RT-pure WXYZ calculations, we would implement:

- Native quadrance calculation using tetrahedral metric tensor
- Spread calculations directly in Quadray space
- Only convert to Cartesian at final GPU boundary (THREE.Vector3 creation)

See `DEV-PRIVATE.md` §7.2.4 for proposed implementation.

### 11.3 Polyhedra Coordinate Mapping

| Polyhedron           | Quadray Pattern | Notes                              |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tetrahedron          | (1,0,0,0) perms | Single active coordinate           |
| Dual Tetrahedron     | (0,1,1,1) perms | Single inactive coordinate         |
| Octahedron           | (1,1,0,0) perms | Two active coordinates             |
| Cube                 | (2,1,1,0) perms | Dominant + two secondary           |
| Cuboctahedron        | Mixed           | 12 vertices at (1,1,0,0) positions |
| Rhombic Dodecahedron | Mixed           | 14 vertices (6 axis + 8 octant)    |

## 11.4 Understanding Quadray Rules: "Only 3 of 4 Needed"

**Reference:** [Kirby Urner - Quadray Introduction](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/quadintro.html)

The grunch.net introduction to Quadrays presents two fundamental rules:

| Rule       | Statement                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rule 1** | "At least one of the four quadrays is always zero"        |
| **Rule 2** | "Only positive numbers (and zero) are needed for any ray" |

These rules seem counterintuitive at first. How can we reach any point in 3D space using only three directions with positive values?

### 11.4.1 The Geometric Intuition

**The Laser Beam Analogy (Direction Only):**

Imagine a laser at the origin. It can point in any direction. But pointing doesn't get you _to_ a point—you need to travel a distance. The Quadray claim is about **reaching** points, not just pointing at them.

**The Vector Addition Insight:**

The key is **vector addition** (tip-to-tail combination), not single-vector extension. With three non-coplanar basis vectors, you can reach any point in their "positive span" by combining them with positive weights:

```
Point P = a·W + b·X + c·Y  (where a, b, c ≥ 0)
```

Since the four Quadray basis vectors together cover ALL directions, at least one set of three will have any target point P in their positive span. The fourth basis vector points "away" from P—you don't need it.

**The "Behind You" Intuition:**

Picture standing at the origin of a tetrahedron. You want to reach point P somewhere in space. Three of the four vertices will be "in front of you" (in the general direction of P), and one will be "behind you." You can reach P by combining the three forward-ish directions with positive weights. The backward direction is superfluous.

### 11.4.2 How "Positive Only" Works

In Cartesian coordinates, to go "left" you need negative X. But in Quadray, the four basis vectors **already cover all directions** with positive values.

The magic comes from **vectorial neutrality**: W + X + Y + Z = 0 (in Cartesian terms).

This means: **-W = X + Y + Z**

To go "opposite" of W, you don't need -W; you use the sum of the other three. The "opposite" of any direction is the _sum_ of the remaining three directions—no negatives required!

### 11.4.3 The Normalization Choice

Two normalization methods are described:

| Method           | Constraint                           | Effect                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **All-positive** | Add (k,k,k,k) to eliminate negatives | Brings most negative to zero |
| **Zero-sum**     | a+b+c+d = 0                          | Reduces 4 DOF to 3 DOF       |

This is the **±(1,1,1,1) bridge** we use for tetrahedron ↔ dual tetrahedron conversion.

### 11.4.4 The ARTexplorer Tension: Continuous Motion vs. Coordinate Substitution

**The grunch.net rules require coordinate substitution:**

```
Instead of:  (-1, 0, 0, 0)  ← "negative W"
Use:         (0, 1, 1, 1)   ← "sum of X+Y+Z" (equivalent position)
```

**But in ARTexplorer, when you drag along -W:**

- The W coordinate continuously decreases through zero
- It naturally becomes negative
- We do NOT substitute (0, 1, 1, 1)—we preserve the native coordinate path

**This is correct for our framework because:**

1. We do NOT enforce zero-sum normalization
2. We preserve the native 4-DOF system
3. Negative coordinates are _meaningful_ in our Janus framework (see §5)
4. Coordinate substitution would obscure the geometry of scaling through origin

**The grunch.net "positive only" rule is a constraint choice, not a geometric necessity.** Our framework deliberately breaks it to explore the full signed Quadray space, including passage through the Janus Point.

### 11.4.5 Reconciling the Frameworks

| Aspect                    | Standard Quadray (grunch.net)      | ARTexplorer Native Quadray |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Negatives allowed?        | No (substitute with sum of others) | Yes (required for Janus)   |
| Zero-sum constraint       | Enforced (3 DOF)                   | Optional (native 4 DOF)    |
| Coordinate substitution   | Required at axis crossing          | Never (continuous motion)  |
| Compatible with Cartesian | Yes (isomorphic)                   | Extended (4D±)             |

The standard Quadray system is a **coordinate language** for 3D Cartesian space. Our extended system is a **native 4D± framework** that uses Quadray as its foundation but explores regions and operations that the standard constraint system deliberately excludes.

---

## 11.5 The 4D-Tetrahedron Demonstrator

To visualize the difference between standard Quadray (with substitution) and native Quadray (continuous signed coordinates), we implement a special polyhedron defined purely in Quadray space.

### 11.5.1 Design Goals

| Feature                    | Purpose                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Native WXYZ definition** | Vertices defined as [w,x,y,z] tuples, not XYZ |
| **Deferred conversion**    | XYZ computed only at render time              |
| **Normalization options**  | Toggle zero-sum constraint on/off             |
| **Dual display**           | Show both coordinate systems simultaneously   |
| **Deformation support**    | Allow (1,1,1,6) "stretched" tetrahedra        |

### 11.5.2 Implementation

```

### 11.5.3 Usage Examples

**Regular Tetrahedron (standard normalized):**

```javascript
const regularTet = Polyhedra.quadrayTetrahedron(1, { normalize: true });
// Vertices at basis vector directions, equal edge lengths
```

**Regular Tetrahedron (native 4D, no normalization):**

```javascript
const nativeTet = Polyhedra.quadrayTetrahedron(1, { normalize: false });
// Same geometry, but wxyz_normalized preserves original coordinates
```

**Deformed Tetrahedron (Z-stretched):**

```javascript
const stretchedTet = Polyhedra.quadrayTetrahedronDeformed(1, 3);
// Z vertex at (0,0,0,3) — three times further than others
// Demonstrates that 4th coordinate carries real geometric information
```

### 11.5.4 What This Demonstrates

| With normalize: true                       | With normalize: false                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| (1,0,0,0) → (0.75, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25)    | (1,0,0,0) → (1,0,0,0)                      |
| Zero-sum constraint enforced               | Native 4-tuple preserved                   |
| Equivalent to standard 3D Quadray          | Extended 4D± system                        |
| (1,1,1,6) collapses to regular tetrahedron | (1,1,1,6) renders as stretched tetrahedron |

The deformed tetrahedron is the key insight: **the fourth coordinate carries real geometric information that zero-sum normalization destroys.**

### 11.5.5 Rendering Pipeline

```
WXYZ Definition → [Optional Normalization] → Quadray.toCartesian() → THREE.Vector3 → GPU
     ↑                    ↑                           ↑                    ↑
  Your math          Constraint choice          One-time              Rendering
  (pure Quadray)     (on/off toggle)           conversion            (standard)
```

The conversion to XYZ happens at the _definition_ stage, not during rendering. The GPU receives standard THREE.Vector3 positions—it doesn't know or care that they originated from Quadray coordinates.

**This means:**

- No performance penalty for Quadray-defined polyhedra
- All existing rendering, interaction, and Janus inversion works unchanged
- We can toggle normalization to explore both standard and extended Quadray

## 13. Implementation: Janus Inversion (Through-Origin Scaling)

**Branch:** `Kali-Yuga`
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Core Implementation)

---

### 13.1 Overview

The Janus Inversion feature enables individual polyhedra to scale through the origin point, passing from positive dimensional space (4D+) into negative dimensional space (4D-). This implements the theoretical framework described in Section 4.1 (Topological Inversion Conjecture) and Section 5 (Negative Dimensionality).

**Key Concept:** When a selected polyhedron's scale passes through zero, it doesn't simply shrink to nothing — it inverts through the Janus Point (origin) and emerges in the complementary dimensional space. This is the geometric equivalent of Barbour's cosmological theory and Fuller's IN/OUT directionality.

---

### 13.2 User Experience Design

**Interaction Flow:**

1. User selects a polyhedron (Form or Instance)
2. User activates Scale mode (gumball)
3. User drags the central sphere (uniform scaling) toward the origin
4. As scale approaches zero, an **animated transition** triggers
5. The polyhedron "collapses" through origin and re-emerges inverted
6. Inverted form renders into white background, from former black background

**Visual Feedback:**

- **Positive space (4D+):** Normal solid rendering, black background
- **Transition zone (approaching 0):** Increasing transparency, possible particle/dissolve effect
- **Origin crossing:** Brief flash/pulse animation (the "Janus moment")
- **Negative space (4D-):** Translucent ghost rendering of remainder of polyhedra NOT affected by this scaling transformation (opacity ~0.3-0.4), **WHITE background**

**Background Inversion (Key Visual Cue):**
When ANY form exists in negative dimensional space, the entire scene background inverts from black to white. This dramatic shift signals unmistakably that we have entered a different dimensional realm — the "negative universe" or anti-space. The contrast inversion also ensures ghost forms remain visible (dark translucent on white vs. light translucent on black).

---

### 13.3 Technical Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Scaling Logic

**File:** `modules/rt-init.js` (lines 2455-2540)

**Current behavior:**

```javascript
// Line 2500 - Current clamping prevents negative values
const clampedScale = Math.max(0.1, Math.min(10.0, newScale));
```

**New behavior:**

```javascript
// Allow negative scaling, detect origin crossing
const JANUS_THRESHOLD = 0.05; // Zone near zero triggers transition
const previousScale = poly.userData.currentScale || 1.0;
const crossedOrigin =
  (previousScale > 0 && newScale < 0) || (previousScale < 0 && newScale > 0);

if (crossedOrigin) {
  // Trigger Janus transition animation
  triggerJanusTransition(poly, previousScale > 0 ? "inward" : "outward");
}

// Allow full range but clamp magnitude
const clampedScale =
  Math.sign(newScale) * Math.max(0.1, Math.min(10.0, Math.abs(newScale)));
```

#### Phase 2: Janus Transition Animation

**New function:** `triggerJanusTransition(polyhedron, direction)`

**Animation sequence:**

1. **Collapse phase** (200ms): Scale rapidly toward zero with increasing transparency
2. **Flash phase** (50ms): Brief white/golden flash at origin point
3. **Emerge phase** (200ms): Scale outward with remainder polyhedra ghost opacity, inverted geometry
4. **Settle phase** (100ms): Opacity stabilizes at ghost level

**Implementation approach:**

- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation
- Store animation state in `poly.userData.janusAnimation`
- Disable gumball interaction during animation

#### Phase 3: Ghost Rendering

**Visual state tracking:**

```javascript
poly.userData.dimensionalState = "positive"; // or 'negative'
poly.userData.isInverted = false; // or true after crossing
```

**Material modifications for ghost state:**

- Opacity: 0.35 (configurable)
- Emissive: slight glow to distinguish from transparent positive forms
- Side: `THREE.DoubleSide` (inverted winding order visible)
- DepthWrite: false (proper layering with positive forms)

#### Phase 4: Background Inversion

**Scene background management:**

```javascript
// Track global dimensional state
let hasNegativeForms = false;

function updateDimensionalBackground() {
  // Check if ANY form is in negative space
  hasNegativeForms = scene.children.some(
    child => child.userData.dimensionalState === "negative"
  );

  // Animate background transition
  const targetColor = hasNegativeForms ? 0xffffff : 0x000000;
  animateBackgroundColor(scene.background, targetColor, 300); // 300ms transition
}
```

**Visual implications:**

- Grid lines may need color inversion for visibility
- Basis vector colors remain unchanged (they exist in both spaces)
- UI panels remain dark (only 3D viewport inverts)

#### Phase 5: State Persistence

**Extend state manager** (`rt-state-manager.js`) to save/load:

- `dimensionalState`: 'positive' | 'negative'
- `isInverted`: boolean
- `currentScale`: can be negative
- Scene background state (derived from form states)

---

### 13.4 Technical Considerations

**THREE.js Negative Scale Behavior:**

- `object.scale.set(-1, -1, -1)` inverts geometry correctly
- Face winding order reverses (CCW becomes CW)
- Need `THREE.DoubleSide` or manual backface handling
- Normals point inward for negative scale

**Coordinate System Implications:**

- Inverted tetrahedron vertices: (-1,0,0,0), (0,-1,0,0), etc. in raw Quadray
- Maintains same centroid at origin
- Relationship to dual tetrahedron: inversion ≠ dual (dual is different vertex set)

**Performance Notes:**

- Animation uses existing render loop
- Ghost material can be shared across inverted forms
- No geometry regeneration needed (scale transform only)

### 13.6 Dimensional Transition Rules (Resolved)

These rules govern how forms behave during dimensional transitions:

#### Rule 1: Individual Selection Scaling

When a selected polyhedron is scaled toward negative space:

- **Non-selected positive forms ghost out** (fade to translucent) during the transition
- This creates a "spotlight" effect on the form crossing the Janus Point
- Once the selected form enters negative space, background inverts to white
- Non-selected forms remain ghosted until the inverting form settles

#### Rule 2: Global Inversion (Future Feature)

When global scale sliders support negative values:

- **ALL active forms pass through origin together**, preserving relative relationships
- This represents the "cosmic breath" — the entire universe inhaling through the Janus Point
- Individual inversion = local event; Global inversion = universal event
- Background inverts as the collective crosses zero

#### Rule 3: Dual Relationship Preservation

When a "parent" form inverts, its dual's relationship inverts too:

- The dual tetrahedron displayed as (0,1,1,1), (1,0,1,1), etc. is the raw negative form (-1,0,0,0), (0,-1,0,0) **normalized by +(1,1,1,1)** to show in positive space
- When the parent inverts to negative space, the dual's normalization relationship inverts
- **Double-negative becomes positive**: An inverted parent's dual would be normalized by -(1,1,1,1), effectively returning to raw negative coordinates
- This maintains the fundamental ±(1,1,1,1) translation relationship across dimensional boundaries

**Philosophical Note:** The dual is already a "shadow" of negative space projected into positive space. Global inversion reveals this truth — what appeared as the dual in positive space was always the true negative form, and vice versa.

---

### 13.7 Open Questions (Remaining)

1. **Axis-constrained scaling:** Should negative scaling be allowed on individual axes (non-uniform inversion), or only uniform through central sphere? _Recommendation: Uniform only for v1_

2. **IVM/Matrix context:** How do inverted forms interact with the IVM lattice visualization? Should negative space forms be excluded from IVM, or rendered as ghost lattice points?

---

### 13.8 Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Selected polyhedron can scale through zero via gumball
- [x] Animated transition plays when crossing origin (golden flash at Janus Point)
- [x] Background inverts black↔white when crossing origin
- [x] Non-selected forms ghost out during individual scaling transition
- [x] Global scale sliders support negative values (-3.6 to 3.6 / -5.0 to 5.0)
- [x] Global slider crossing triggers universal background inversion
- [x] Debounced crossing detection prevents double-trigger at zero
- [x] Console logs dimensional state changes for debugging
- [ ] Inverted forms render as translucent ghosts (partial - non-selected ghost during transition only)
- [ ] State persists in save/load (Phase 5 - future)

---

### 13.9 Discovered Issues & Future Work

During implementation, the following edge cases and extensions were identified:

#### Issue 1: Cross-Dimensional Ghost Rendering

**Scenario:** An instance of a polyhedron is scaled into negative space (e.g., a negative cube), but then the global slider or base form is scaled back into positive space.

**Question:** Should the negative cube appear as a ghost in positive space?

**Answer:** YES. Forms that exist in the opposite dimensional space from the current global state should render as ghosts. This creates a consistent visual language:

- **Positive global space + negative form** → form appears as ghost
- **Negative global space + positive form** → form appears as ghost

This reinforces the concept that ghosts are "shadows" of the other dimensional realm.

#### Issue 2: Mixed-Dimensional Scenes

When both positive and negative forms coexist, the background state must be determined by:

- The **most recently crossed** form, OR
- The **majority** dimensional state, OR
- A **user-selected** primary dimension

_Recommendation:_ For v2, implement a "dimensional focus" concept where the user can lock the background to a specific state, with cross-dimensional forms ghosted.

#### Issue 3: State Persistence (Phase 5)

The `rt-state-manager.js` must be extended to save/load:

- `dimensionalState` per polyhedron
- `globalDimensionalState` for scene
- Negative scale values
- Background color state

### 13.10 Theoretical Context & Original Contributions

This section documents the intellectual lineage of the Janus Inversion concept and clarifies what appears to be original to this work.

#### Related Work (Acknowledged Influences)

**Julian Barbour - The Janus Point (2020)**
Barbour's work proposes that time flows in two directions from a minimal-order "Janus Point" at the Big Bang. His 2014 paper with Koslowski and Mercati ("Identification of a Gravitational Arrow of Time," Physical Review Letters 113:181101) provides peer-reviewed foundations. However, Barbour addresses _temporal_ reversal, not spatial/dimensional inversion. His work does not propose "negative space" as a geometric concept.

#### Correspondence with Dr. Julian Barbour (22 January 2026)

In response to an early draft of this work shared by email, Dr. Julian Barbour graciously replied:

> Dear Andy,
>
> Thanks for this and for your kind comments. However, I am afraid I am a bit too old and out of your field to grasp the full significance of what you have said. However, I do find things like the Platonic solids very interesting. This is because I'm getting more and more convinced that science should be about shapes rather than dynamics. In fact one can see from early Greek thinking, starting with the myths associated with the constellations, and then the ideas of Plato and the atomists, who according to Lucretius were trying to explain the shapes of microscopic object and creatures of different genera, that very naturally they were trying to understand the origin of shapes. I think it is just possible that the development of dynamics, which happened at about the same time as Lucretius wrote his book when Hipparchus developed the first dynamical theory, his theory of the motion of the Sun around the ecliptic with the rotation of the Earth defining time, may have marked a wrong turn. I'm currently writing a book which will include discussion of that.
>
> One other thing that I might say is that I am now not quite so keen on the Janus-point solutions in Newton gravity. That is not because there is anything wrong in what I said about them in my recent book but rather that if one eliminates all the absolute elements with which I would say Newton corrupted his own theory, then all that is left is Big Bang solutions as described in chapter 16 of my book. In this case bidirectional arrows of time are replaced by a monodirectional one.
>
> Best wishes and thanks again for your interest,

> Julian.

**Analysis and Implications for This Work:**

Dr. Barbour's response contains several significant points:

1. **"Science should be about shapes rather than dynamics"** — This observation _strengthens_ the relevance of our geometric approach. We are doing precisely this: exploring the shapes of space through tetrahedral geometry rather than tracking motions through time. Barbour's suggestion that Hipparchus's dynamical turn "may have marked a wrong turn" aligns remarkably with Fuller's critique of Cartesian/Newtonian frameworks.

2. **Revised view on Janus Points** — Barbour now favors **monodirectional** Big Bang solutions (Chapter 16 of _The Janus Point_) over bidirectional Janus Point solutions when Newtonian absolute elements are fully eliminated. This is an important clarification of his current thinking.

3. **Our domain is different** — Critically, our geometric extension applies the Janus Point concept to _spatial_ rather than _temporal_ structure. The geometric Janus Point we describe is a property of tetrahedral coordinate systems—the origin as a transition point between positive and negative dimensional spaces—not a claim about the cosmological arrow of time. Barbour's refinement of his temporal theory does not affect our spatial/geometric application.

4. **Shapes vs. Dynamics alignment** — Barbour's intuition that science took a "wrong turn" toward dynamics resonates with:
   - Fuller's emphasis on structure over motion
   - Wildberger's algebraic approach to geometry (avoiding limits and infinitesimals)
   - Our use of Quadrance and Spread rather than distance and angle
   - The fundamental claim that the tetrahedron (a shape) is the minimum system, not any dynamic process

We are grateful for Dr. Barbour's engagement and particularly for his encouragement that "science should be about shapes rather than dynamics." This view aligns naturally with everything we are attempting here.

**CPT Symmetry (Lüders, Pauli, Schwinger - 1951-1954)**
The CPT theorem describes a theoretical "mirror universe" where charge, parity, and time are simultaneously inverted. This is established physics but concerns antimatter and mirrored particle interactions, not geometric scaling through an origin into negative dimensionality.

- [CPT Symmetry (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT_symmetry)

**Benoit Mandelbrot - Negative Fractal Dimensions**
Mandelbrot explored negative dimensions as a mathematical measure of "emptiness" in sets — a purely formal construction with no physical interpretation proposed.

- [Negative Fractal Dimensions (Yale)](https://users.math.yale.edu/users/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/123negativeFractalDimensions.pdf)

**R. Buckminster Fuller - Synergetics**
Fuller's IN/OUT directionality (replacing Cartesian UP/DOWN) and tetrahedral coordinate thinking inform this work deeply. His emphasis on the origin as the observer's position and radial vectors as primary geometric elements aligns naturally with Janus Inversion.

**N.J. Wildberger - Rational Trigonometry**
The algebraic exactness of quadrance and spread allows us to maintain mathematical rigor when describing forms in both positive and negative dimensional spaces.

#### Why This Remained Hidden: The Cartesian Blind Spot

Human habituation to the XYZ coordinate system may have long obscured the possibility of negative dimensional space. In Cartesian coordinates, the eight octants created by negative X, Y, and Z values all remain _within_ the same 3D reference frame — they are merely directional extensions of the same space. There is no conceptual "outside" to Cartesian space; negative coordinates simply point the other way.

Quadray coordinates (WXYZ) operate differently. With four basis vectors extending from a tetrahedral origin, all coordinates in "normal" space are non-negative. This immediately raises the question that Cartesian thinking never prompts: _what, then, is a negative position in this framework?_ The answer cannot be "the other direction" because there is no other direction — the four basis vectors already span all of 3D space with positive values only.

This distinction becomes vivid in ARTexplorer. When the XYZ basis vectors invert through the origin, they do not turn "inside-out" — they merely flip from right-hand rule to left-hand rule orientation, remaining recognizably within the same spatial framework. But when quadray-defined forms invert through the Janus Point, something categorically different occurs: they pass into a space that positive quadray coordinates cannot describe. The ±(1,1,1,1) normalization bridge between tetrahedron and dual tetrahedron hints at this hidden realm, but Cartesian thinking — with its symmetrical positive/negative axes — provided no reason to look for it.

This may explain why negative dimensional space remained invisible to mathematicians and philosophers for so long. The question simply cannot arise within Cartesian assumptions. Only by adopting a coordinate system where "negative" has no directional meaning does the deeper question emerge: negative _what_, exactly? And once asked, the answer points toward a complementary dimensional realm that Cartesian geometry, by its very structure, was designed to make unthinkable.

#### What Appears to Be Original

As of January 2026, no published work appears to combine these concepts into a unified framework:

1. **Geometric Janus Inversion** — Applying Barbour's temporal Janus Point concept to _spatial_ geometry, where forms scale through an origin into negative dimensionality

2. **Negative Dimensional Space (4D-)** — Proposing that negative scale values represent existence in a complementary dimensional realm, not merely "inverted geometry"

3. **Quadray Implementation** — Using tetrahedral coordinates (WXYZ) to mathematically describe forms in both 4D+ and 4D- space, with the ±(1,1,1,1) normalization as the bridge between realms

4. **Visual Semantics** — The black/white background inversion as a perceptual signal of dimensional state; ghost rendering for cross-dimensional forms

#### Intuitions Awaiting Formalization

The following conjectures emerge from decades of contemplative practice and geometric intuition. They are recorded here not as claims but as directions for future exploration:

**Scale-Invariant Janus Points**
Inversion through origin may occur at every scale of existence — from subatomic to cosmic. What we observe as "particles" may be local eddies of dimensional inversion. What we observe as "black holes" may be macro-scale Janus Points where spacetime itself inverts through the origin.

**Energy Twinning**
Every manifestation of energy in positive space may have a paired "twin" in negative space. This is not antimatter (which exists in positive space with opposite charge) but something more fundamental — a complementary existence across the dimensional boundary. The conservation laws we observe may be shadows of a deeper bidimensional conservation.

**The Dual as Shadow**
The dual tetrahedron, rendered in positive space via +(1,1,1,1) normalization, is already a projection of negative space into our realm. Global inversion doesn't create something new — it reveals what was always there. The relationship between form and dual may be the most accessible window into understanding positive/negative dimensional pairing.

**Breathing Universe**
The "cosmic breath" metaphor — all forms inhaling through the Janus Point together — suggests that universal expansion and contraction may be aspects of a dimensional oscillation. The Big Bang may not be a beginning but a Janus Point through which existence continuously flows in both temporal and dimensional directions.

These intuitions feel natural and self-evident to contemplative experience. The purpose of ARTexplorer is to provide tools for visualizing and testing these ideas geometrically, allowing intuition and mathematics to inform each other.

#### Anticipated Counter-Arguments & Response

**The XYZ Rendering Objection**

A mathematician could object: "The current ARTexplorer implementation renders everything through THREE.js, which uses standard XYZ Cartesian coordinates. The 'Janus Inversion' is simply `scale.set(-1, -1, -1)` — ordinary negative scaling that any 3D engine can perform. The visual effects are arbitrary UI design choices, not mathematical necessities. XYZ handles negative coordinates perfectly well. Nothing is 'hidden' — the entire demonstration occurs in Cartesian space at the GPU level."

This objection deserves a direct response.

**What We Already Have**

The mathematical foundations documented in this specification are substantial:

1. **Quadray Basis Vectors** (Section 2) — Four tetrahedral basis vectors with precise Cartesian equivalents, maintaining the property that all positive combinations span 3D space
2. **Rational Trigonometry** (Section 8) — Quadrance and spread calculations that maintain algebraic exactness throughout geometric operations
3. **The ±(1,1,1,1) Normalization Bridge** (Section 4) — A mathematically defined translation between positive and negative Quadray representations
4. **Weierstrass Substitution** (Section 8.4) — Pure rational rotation without transcendental functions
5. **Algebraic Exactness** — XYZ conversion deferred to the GPU boundary; intermediate calculations remain in rational form

The current implementation already performs geometry in Quadray/RT space before converting to XYZ for rendering. The question is not whether we have mathematics — we do — but whether the XYZ rendering layer undermines the conceptual claim about negative dimensionality.

**The Subtler Claim**

We do not claim that XYZ _cannot_ represent inverted geometry — it obviously can. The claim is that XYZ's symmetric ±axes make the _question_ of negative dimensionality structurally invisible. In XYZ, the point (-1, -1, -1) is simply "the opposite octant" — still conceptually within the same 3D space. The framework never prompts you to ask "what _is_ negative space?"

In Quadray coordinates, where all positive values already span 3D, negative coordinates have no directional interpretation. This forces a categorically different question: negative _what_?

**Future Development: Native 4D Rendering**

To fully realize the mathematical framework, future work should eliminate the XYZ conversion entirely:

1. **Native 4D Rendering Engine** — A purpose-built renderer operating in tetrahedral coordinate space, where:
   - All transformations occur in WXYZ using rational algebra
   - No Cartesian conversion until final pixel output
   - Negative Quadray coordinates handled natively, not as XYZ proxies
   - Computational efficiency gains from tetrahedral symmetry

2. **Extended Signed Quadray Algebra** — Formalize the mathematics of WXYZ where negative values are permitted:
   - Quadrance calculations across the ±(1,1,1,1) boundary
   - Transformation matrices for 4D± space
   - Topological characterization of the origin as dimensional transition point

The current ARTexplorer demonstrates Janus Inversion through XYZ rendering, but the underlying Quadray mathematics is real and operational. The visual metaphor is built on genuine algebraic foundations — foundations that await only a native 4D renderer to be fully expressed.

## 14. Quadray Demonstrators UI Controls

**Added:** 2026-01-24

The Quadray Tetrahedron demonstrators are accessible via the Forms panel in the ARTexplorer UI.

### 14.1 Control Panel Location

In the Forms panel (left side), under the **"Quadray Demonstrators"** divider:

| Control                             | Description                                                             |

| **Z-Stretch**                       | Slider (0.5 to 4.0) controlling the fourth vertex stretch factor        |

### 14.2 Visual Appearance

| Form                         | Color                      | Notes                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quadray Tetrahedron          | Bright teal/mint (#00ff88) | Vertices at (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,1) |
| Quadray Tetrahedron Deformed | Coral-pink (#ff5577)       | Z vertex stretched by slider value                     |

### 14.3 Interactive Exploration

**Normalization Toggle Experiment:**

1. Enable "Quadray Tetrahedron (4D Native)"
2. Toggle the "Normalize" checkbox
3. Observe: With normalize OFF, the tetrahedron uses raw WXYZ coordinates
4. With normalize ON, zero-sum normalization is applied (standard Quadray)

**Deformation Experiment:**

1. Enable "Quadray Tetrahedron Deformed"
2. Adjust the Z-Stretch slider from 0.5 to 4.0
3. Observe: One vertex moves closer or further from the other three
4. This demonstrates that the 4th coordinate carries **real geometric information** when normalization is NOT applied

### 14.4 Console Logging

Both demonstrators log RT validation data to the browser console:

```
[RT] Quadray Tetrahedron: normalize=true, scale=1
  WXYZ raw: [1,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,1]
  WXYZ normalized: ["0.750","-0.250","-0.250","-0.250"]
  Sample edge Q: 1.333333

[RT] Deformed Quadray Tetrahedron: Z stretched by 2x
  Standard tetrahedron: (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,1)
  Deformed tetrahedron: (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,2)
  With zero-sum: Z vertex would normalize to (0,0,0,1) — deformation LOST
  Without zero-sum: Z vertex stays at (0,0,0,2) — deformation PRESERVED
```

### 14.5 Node Spheres

Both Quadray demonstrators render node spheres at each vertex. The nodes follow the global node visibility and opacity settings from the Visual Options panel.
