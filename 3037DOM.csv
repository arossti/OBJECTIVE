The COP derived from the HSPF (HSPF/3.412 = COPhtg) is generally COP+1 of the COP for the cooling season, because the COPhtg generally adds a factor of '1' to the heating load from the compressor's own heat. In other words the first 1 of a COPhtg is the same as an electric baseboard, the rest of the increase is a heat multiplier per Watt of electricity used to drive the comporessor. Refer to MNEC Table 5.2.12.1-A to G for COP and HSPF compliance requirements. If Cooling (B.1.2. is Yes, the efficiency from this section will be applied even if 'No' is selected for HP for Heating. This reflects all cases where houses have A/C only and do not use a Heatpump also for heating. ",
