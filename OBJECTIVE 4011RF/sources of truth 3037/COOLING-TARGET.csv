NOTE:,,"These cooling load and free cooling calculations are simplified models to determine a cooling loads over the entire cooling season from a very limite set of data, like CCD or Seasonal Averages and/or July 2.5% peak temperatures (Wet and Dry). 

Net free cooling is calculated as a function of the cooling season seasonal averages, and the ability for the building to exhaust the calculated daily gains in less than a 12-hour period, typically overnight. The benefit of increased ventilation is diminished by the  latency of the cooling load introduced by ventilation, or in other words Increasing ventilation rates also increases the latent load. Incoming, more humid fresh air is subject to a latent load factor calculated above, typically >~140% for Southern Ontario, which imposes the additional cooling load burden. This percentage is calculated by comparing seasonal average wet and dry bulb temperatures against the interior cooling setpoint temperature and targeted relative humidity set on the FACTS worksheet.
