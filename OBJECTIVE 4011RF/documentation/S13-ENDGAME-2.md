# S13-ENDGAME-2.md: The Final Modular Refactoring Plan

**Version**: 3.0 (REVISED)
**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Status**: REVISED STRATEGY - Simpler approach based on Excel worksheet pattern, eliminates context complexity

---

## 1. Executive Summary (REVISED)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The original S13-ENDGAME-2 "context objects" approach is **over-engineered**. Heating and ventilation calculations work fine in S13 - the ONLY problematic area is cooling calculations.

**REVISED APPROACH**: Keep S13 simple, delegate ONLY cooling to external module(s):
- **S13 keeps**: Heating calculations (H113, D114, etc.) - WORKING
- **S13 keeps**: Ventilation calculations (D119-D123) - WORKING
- **S13 delegates**: Cooling physics ONLY (Cooling.js mirrors COOLING-TARGET.csv)
- **No context objects**: Modules read directly from StateManager when needed

This mirrors the Excel architecture: FORMULAE worksheet (S13) references COOLING-TARGET worksheet via cross-references.

## 2. The Revised Principle: Keep S13 Simple (REVISED)

**What Changed**: Original plan called for extracting ALL calculations (heating, ventilation, cooling) into separate modules. This is unnecessary complexity.

**New Principle**: Extract ONLY the problematic cooling calculations.

### **S13 Architecture (REVISED):**

-   **S13 Section File (`4012-Section13.js`)**: 
    - Manages dual-state UI (ModeManager, TargetState, ReferenceState)
    - Calculates heating (H113, J113, D114, L113, etc.) - STAYS in S13
    - Calculates ventilation (D119-D123) - STAYS in S13
    - **Delegates cooling physics** to Cooling.js module
    - Uses CHEATSHEET Pattern 1 (temporary mode switching) for automatic mode awareness

-   **Cooling Module (`4012-Cooling.js`)**:
    - Mirrors COOLING-TARGET.csv worksheet
    - Calculates ONLY cooling physics (A6, A33, E55, atmospheric)
    - Accepts `mode` parameter: `calculateAll(mode = "target")`
    - Reads mode-aware StateManager values (`${prefix}d_21`)
    - Publishes mode-aware results (`${prefix}cooling_latentLoadFactor`)
    - **No context objects** - reads directly from StateManager

### **Why This Works:**
- S13 heating/ventilation calculations already work - don't touch them
- Cooling complexity isolated to dedicated module
- Mode-aware via parameter, not complex context building
- Eliminates initialization timing errors (no upfront validation)

## 3. The REVISED Workplan (Sept 30, 2025)

**SIMPLIFIED STRATEGY**: Methodical, testable approach focusing on what's actually broken.

### **Phase 1: Fix S13 Core Calculations (Heating & Ventilation) ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS**

**Status**: Architectural cleanup complete, now fixing calculation bugs

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Removed 600+ lines of debug/commented code
- ‚úÖ Eliminated duplicate functions between S13 and Cooling.js
- ‚úÖ 9/9 CHEATSHEET compliance achieved
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (field definitions)
- ‚úÖ Strict error handling (no silent fallbacks)

**Current Task**: 
- üîß Fix heating calculation bugs (H113, J113, D114, L113, F114, etc.)
- üîß Fix ventilation calculation bugs (D119-D123)
- üîß Achieve Excel parity for S13 rows 113-124 (excluding cooling integration)

**Goal**: S13 heating/ventilation calculations match FORMULAE-3039.csv exactly.

---

### **Phase 2: Fix Cooling.js (Target Model Only)**

**After** S13 heating/ventilation works perfectly:

1. **Simplify Cooling.js** - Remove context complexity
   - Delete `createIsolatedCoolingContext()` from S13
   - Delete `coolingState`, `coolingContext` shared objects
   - Delete `runIntegratedCoolingCalculations()`
   - Cooling.js reads directly from StateManager (no upfront validation)

2. **Make Cooling.js mode-aware** via parameter:
   ```javascript
   // Cooling.js
   calculateAll(mode = "target") {
     const prefix = mode === "reference" ? "ref_" : "";
     const cdd = StateManager.getValue(`${prefix}d_21`);
     // ... calculate using mode-aware reads
     StateManager.setValue(`${prefix}cooling_latentLoadFactor`, result, "calculated");
   }
   ```

3. **S13 calls Cooling.js** for Target model:
   ```javascript
   function calculateTargetModel() {
     // S13 calculations (heating, ventilation)
     calculateCOPValues();
     calculateHeatingSystem();
     calculateVentilationRates();
     
     // Delegate to Cooling.js for Target
     window.TEUI.Cooling.calculateAll("target");
     
     // Use cooling results
     const i_122 = StateManager.getValue("cooling_latentLoadFactor");
     calculateCoolingVentilation(i_122); // S13 owns D122/D123
   }
   ```

4. **Test Target cooling** against COOLING-TARGET.csv
   - Verify A6, A33, E55 calculations
   - Achieve Excel parity for Target model
   - Confirm Clock.js works (no initialization errors)

**Goal**: Target model cooling calculations match COOLING-TARGET.csv exactly.

---

### **Phase 3: Add Reference Model Support**

**After** Target model works perfectly:

1. **Option A (Preferred)**: Single file with mode parameter
   - Cooling.js already mode-aware from Phase 2
   - S13 Reference model calls: `Cooling.calculateAll("reference")`
   - Test Reference cooling calculations

2. **Option B (Fallback)**: Separate Reference file
   - Clone Cooling.js ‚Üí Cooling-Ref.js
   - Change all reads: `d_21` ‚Üí `ref_d_21`
   - Change all writes: `cooling_` ‚Üí `ref_cooling_`
   - S13 calls appropriate file per model

**Goal**: Reference model cooling calculations match COOLING-REFERENCE.csv (when created).

---

### **Phase 4: Pattern 1 Migration (Optional Future Enhancement)**

**After** both models work perfectly:

Consider migrating S13 to CHEATSHEET Pattern 1 (temporary mode switching):
- Replace `isReferenceCalculation` parameters
- Use automatic mode awareness
- Simplify calculation functions

**Goal**: Cleaner code, easier maintenance (not required for functionality).

---

### **Phase 5: Final Cleanup**

1. **Remove obsolete code**:
   - Delete `createIsolatedCoolingContext()`
   - Delete `coolingState` object
   - Delete `updateCoolingInputs()` 
   - Delete `runIntegratedCoolingCalculations()`

2. **Confirm state isolation**: Target/Reference modes fully independent

3. **Document architecture**: Update diagrams, comments

## 4. Success Criteria (REVISED)

The refactor is complete when:

-   ‚úÖ `4012-Section13.js` is maintainable (achieved: 3,666 lines, down from 4,259)
-   ‚úÖ S13 heating/ventilation calculations match FORMULAE-3039.csv (rows 113-123)
-   ‚úÖ Cooling.js calculations match COOLING-TARGET.csv (A6, A33, E55)
-   ‚úÖ Target model: All calculations achieve Excel parity
-   ‚úÖ Reference model: All calculations achieve Excel parity
-   ‚úÖ State isolation: Target/Reference modes fully independent
-   ‚úÖ Clock.js works: No initialization errors
-   ‚úÖ 9/9 CHEATSHEET compliance maintained

**NOT REQUIRED** (over-engineering):
-   ‚ùå Extract heating to separate module (works fine in S13)
-   ‚ùå Extract ventilation to separate module (works fine in S13)
-   ‚ùå Context objects (timing errors, unnecessary complexity)

---

## 5. Implementation Status (Sept 30, 2025)

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Architectural Foundation**

**Commits 1-14** (see 4012-COOLING.md for details):
- File size reduction: 4,259 ‚Üí 3,666 lines (-13.9%)
- Debug logging removed: 218 statements
- Duplicate functions eliminated: S13 vs Cooling.js delineated
- CHEATSHEET compliance: 9/9 phases pass
- Documentation: 4012-COOLING.md (755 lines), S13-CHEATSHEET-AUDIT.md (316 lines)

### **üîß CURRENT PHASE: S13 Heating/Ventilation Bug Fixes**

**Known Issues**:
- Clock.js not displaying (caused by strict l_128 errors in createIsolatedCoolingContext)
- Heating calculations may have bugs (need Excel row-by-row comparison)
- Ventilation calculations may have bugs (need Excel row-by-row comparison)

**Approach**:
1. Fix heating calculations first (rows 113-115)
2. Fix ventilation calculations (rows 118-121)
3. Test against Excel for each row
4. Once S13 core works, move to Cooling.js

### **üìã NEXT PHASE: Cooling.js Simplification**

**After** S13 heating/ventilation achieves Excel parity:

1. Remove context complexity from S13:
   - Delete `createIsolatedCoolingContext()`
   - Delete `coolingState`, `updateCoolingInputs()`
   - Delete `runIntegratedCoolingCalculations()`

2. Refactor Cooling.js to mode-aware pattern:
   ```javascript
   calculateAll(mode = "target") {
     const prefix = mode === "reference" ? "ref_" : "";
     // Read mode-aware values
     const cdd = StateManager.getValue(`${prefix}d_21`) || 0;
     // Publish mode-aware results
     StateManager.setValue(`${prefix}cooling_latentLoadFactor`, result, "calculated");
   }
   ```

3. S13 orchestrates:
   ```javascript
   calculateTargetModel() {
     // ... S13 heating/ventilation ...
     Cooling.calculateAll("target");
     // Use cooling_latentLoadFactor, cooling_m_124, etc.
   }
   
   calculateReferenceModel() {
     // ... S13 heating/ventilation ...
     Cooling.calculateAll("reference");
     // Use ref_cooling_latentLoadFactor, ref_cooling_m_124, etc.
   }
   ```

4. Test Target cooling against COOLING-TARGET.csv

**Fallback Plan**: If single-file mode parameter doesn't work cleanly, use separate Cooling-Ref.js file.

---

## 6. Key Architectural Decisions (REVISED)

### **‚úÖ KEEP in S13.js:**
- Heating system calculations (rows 113-115) - WORKING BEFORE CLEANUP
- Ventilation calculations (rows 118-123) - WORKING BEFORE CLEANUP
- Cooling system integration (D117, L114) - S13 owns per FORMULAE
- Free cooling orchestration (H124) - S13 applies setback to Cooling.js A33

### **‚úÖ DELEGATE to Cooling.js:**
- Latent load factor (COOLING-TARGET A6)
- Daily free cooling physics (COOLING-TARGET A28-A33)
- Days active cooling (COOLING-TARGET E55)
- Atmospheric/humidity calculations (COOLING-TARGET A56-A63)
- Wet bulb temperature (COOLING-TARGET E64-E66)
- CED calculations D129/M129 (timing exception - stays in Cooling.js)

### **‚ùå DO NOT extract:**
- Heating calculations (no benefit, adds complexity)
- Ventilation calculations (no benefit, adds complexity)

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

### **What Didn't Work:**
- ‚ùå Context objects (`createIsolatedCoolingContext`) - timing errors, over-complexity
- ‚ùå Upfront validation - causes initialization failures
- ‚ùå Extracting working code - heating/ventilation work fine in S13

### **What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Excel worksheet pattern - each JS file = one Excel worksheet
- ‚úÖ StateManager as cross-worksheet reference mechanism
- ‚úÖ Mode parameter for dual-state awareness
- ‚úÖ Keep working code where it is (don't extract for "purity")
- ‚úÖ Fix what's actually broken (cooling), not what works (heating/vent)

---

## 8. Current Status Summary

**File Quality**: ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture (9/9 CHEATSHEET compliance)  
**Calculation Status**: üîß Needs bug fixes (heating, ventilation, cooling)  
**Next Step**: Row-by-row Excel comparison for S13 heating/ventilation  
**Future Step**: Cooling.js mode-aware refactor (after S13 core works)

---

## 9. Implementation Progress (Sept 30, 2025 - End of Day)

- ‚úÖ No Target contamination when changing Reference values
- ‚úÖ Dual-engine calculations working

---

### **üö® CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUES (Final Session - Sept 30):**

#### **Issue #1: d_116 (Cooling Toggle) Has No Effect** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Switching d_116 between "Cooling" and "No Cooling" doesn't trigger recalculation  
**Expected**: Should recalculate D117, L114, L116, D122, D123  
**Current**: Values don't update  
**Impact**: User can't test cooling vs no-cooling scenarios  

#### **Issue #2: g_118 (Ventilation Method) Has No Effect** üö® **CRITICAL**
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Historical failure point  
**Description**: Changing g_118 doesn't update D120 (volumetric ventilation rate)  
**Expected**: 
- "Volume Constant" ‚Üí D120 = (L118 * D105) / 3.6
- "Volume by Schedule" ‚Üí D120 = ((L118 * D105) / 3.6) * (I63/J63)
- "Occupant Constant" ‚Üí D120 = D63 * D119
- "Occupant by Schedule" ‚Üí D120 = (D63 * D119) * (I63/J63)

**Current**: D120 stays at same value regardless of g_118 selection  
**Impact**: Cascading failures - D120 ‚Üí H120 ‚Üí D121 ‚Üí M121 ‚Üí all downstream  
**History**: **EVERY PREVIOUS S13 REFACTOR FAILED HERE** - this is the graveyard  

#### **Issue #3: l_119 (Summer Boost) Has No Effect** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Changing l_119 doesn't update D122 (cooling season ventilation)  
**Expected**: D122 should multiply by boost factor (1.10x, 1.20x, etc.)  
**Current**: D122 doesn't change  
**Impact**: Can't test ventilation boost scenarios  

#### **Issue #4: Minor Calculation Discrepancies**
- d_124 = 67% (expected 61%) - likely M19 or setback calculation
- h_10 = 93.4 (expected 93.7) - likely default values vs Excel
- Both are close enough for now, refinements later

---

### **üìã FINAL SESSION PRIORITIES (Sept 30 Evening):**

**Priority 1: Fix g_118 (CRITICAL - THE GRAVEYARD)** üö®
- Add dropdown change listener for g_118
- Ensure it triggers calculateVentilationRates() ‚Üí D120 recalculation
- Verify D120 uses correct formula per g_118 selection
- Test ALL 4 ventilation methods work correctly
- **This is the make-or-break fix**

**Priority 2: Fix d_116 (Cooling Toggle)**
- Ensure dropdown listener triggers cooling system recalculation
- Verify D117, L114, L116 respond to d_116 changes
- Test Cooling vs No Cooling scenarios

**Priority 3: Fix l_119 (Summer Boost)**
- Ensure dropdown listener triggers D122 recalculation
- Verify boost factor applies correctly to D122 formula

**Priority 4: Remove Strict Errors (Cleanup)**
- Change strict `throw new Error()` to lenient fallbacks in S13 calculateFreeCooling
- Prevents error spam during initialization
- Allows graceful degradation if Cooling.js slow to initialize

---

### **üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR COMPLETION:**

**All 4 ventilation methods work:**
1. Volume Constant - D120 responds correctly ‚úÖ
2. Volume by Schedule - D120 responds correctly ‚úÖ
3. Occupant Constant - D120 responds correctly ‚úÖ
4. Occupant by Schedule - D120 responds correctly ‚úÖ

**Cooling toggle works:**
- d_116 "Cooling" ‚Üí calculations update ‚úÖ
- d_116 "No Cooling" ‚Üí D117, L114, L116 = 0 ‚úÖ

**Summer boost works:**
- l_119 changes ‚Üí D122 updates ‚úÖ

**No errors in Logs.md** ‚úÖ

---

## 10. The g_118 Challenge (Historical Context)

**Why g_118 is Critical:**

This single dropdown has caused **complete refactor failures** in:
- March 2025 attempt: Context objects introduced to fix g_118 ‚Üí state mixing
- June 2025 attempt: Cooling integration to fix g_118 ‚Üí calculation storms
- August 2025 attempt: Pattern 2 migration to fix g_118 ‚Üí reference contamination
- September 2025 attempt: CHUNK pattern to fix g_118 ‚Üí timing errors

**Root Cause Pattern:**
- g_118 changes ‚Üí D120 should recalculate ‚Üí H120 updates ‚Üí D121/M121 update ‚Üí downstream cascade
- **Listener missing or contaminated** ‚Üí D120 never recalculates ‚Üí entire section freezes

**Current Status (Sept 30):**
- Architecture: ‚úÖ Clean (9/9 CHEATSHEET)
- Heating: ‚úÖ Working (rows 113-115)
- Cooling integration: ‚úÖ Working (h_124 exact match)
- **g_118**: üö® Still broken - but now we have clean architecture to fix it

**This is the final boss.** üéØ


---

## 11. Final Session Progress (Sept 30, 2025 - Evening)

### **üéâ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS COMPLETED:**

#### **Architectural Cleanup:**
- ‚úÖ **Context complexity eliminated**: 253 lines removed (createIsolatedCoolingContext, coolingState, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Circular dependency resolved**: D129/M129 moved from Cooling.js to S13
- ‚úÖ **Calculation order fixed**: S13 now calls Cooling.js directly (guaranteed timing)
- ‚úÖ **9/9 CHEATSHEET compliance**: Perfect score maintained
- ‚úÖ **Single source of truth**: Empty state defaults with getFieldDefault() fallback
- ‚úÖ **File size**: 4,259 ‚Üí 3,478 lines (-18.3%)

#### **Excel Formula Compliance:**
- üéØ **h_124 = 37,322.82 kWh/yr** - EXACT EXCEL MATCH!
- ‚úÖ **D117 formula**: IF(D116="No Cooling", 0, IF(D113="Heatpump", M129/J113, IF(D116="Cooling", M129/J116)))
- ‚úÖ **L114 formula**: IF(D113="Heatpump", IF(D116="Cooling", ((D117*J113)-D117), 0), 0)
- ‚úÖ **M129 clamping**: MAX(0, D129 - H124 - D123)
- ‚úÖ **Temperature diff**: Excel A16 = A8 - A3 (indoor - outdoor)
- ‚úÖ **All 2dp formatting**: j_113, j_114, j_116 consistent precision

#### **UI/UX Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ **j_116 ghosting**: Ghosts when No Cooling OR Heatpump (Excel-compliant)
- ‚úÖ **j_116 display**: Shows j_113 when Heatpump, user value when dedicated, 0 when No Cooling
- ‚úÖ **Clock.js restored**: Timing display working (603ms initialization)
- ‚úÖ **l_118 displays**: Shows "3" from field definition default
- ‚úÖ **HSPF slider**: Calculates on thumb release only (no calculation storms)
- ‚úÖ **k_120 slider**: Works perfectly with Target mode isolation

#### **Error Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ **calculateAndRefresh undefined**: Fixed by moving definition to registerWithStateManager()
- ‚úÖ **Cooling.js timing errors**: Fixed by direct call from S13 (no race conditions)
- ‚úÖ **i_59 strict errors**: Made lenient with 45% default
- ‚úÖ **Logs.md clean**: No errors after initialization

#### **Dashboard Results:**
- ‚úÖ **h_10 = 92.8** kWh/m¬≤/yr (close to expected 93.7, 99.0% accurate)
- ‚úÖ **Free cooling impact visible**: Load reduction from 132,486 ‚Üí 129,747 kWh/yr
- ‚úÖ **State isolation**: k_120 changes affect Target only (perfect!)

---

### **üêõ REMAINING BUGS (To Fix):**

#### **Bug #1: Number Format Timing Issue (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Symptom**: After a few user interactions, number formatting degrades:
- Thousands separators disappear: "37,322.82" becomes "37322.82"
- Percentages lose format: "70%" becomes "0.70"
- Doesn't break calculations, but indicates timing/refresh issue

**Hypothesis**: `updateCalculatedDisplayValues()` uses generic "number-2dp" which doesn't preserve thousands separators for large values. Needs field-specific formatting.

**Impact**: Visual inconsistency, user confusion

**Priority**: Medium (calculations work, display issue only)

---

#### **Bug #2: h_10 Initialization Drift (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Symptom**:
- **At initialization**: h_10 = 92.8 kWh/m¬≤/yr
- **Expected**: h_10 = 93.7 kWh/m¬≤/yr
- **After slow-drag d_118 slider**: h_10 = 93.7 kWh/m¬≤/yr ‚úÖ CORRECT!

**Root Cause**: d_118 slider has "input" event that triggers calculations **during dragging**, causing calculation storms and potentially stale values at initialization, but which also refreshes calculations to correct h_10 calculation value...consider if this timing is what is needed to settle all calculations to the correct values rather than terminating before completion. 

**Evidence**:
- Line 1742: `d118Slider.addEventListener("input", ...)` triggers `calculateAll()` during drag
- Line 1706: `f113Slider` only displays during input, calculates on "change" (thumb release)
- Slow drag forces multiple calculation cycles, eventually settling at correct value

**Solution**: Make d_118 slider behave like f_113 slider:
- **"input" event**: Update display only (no calculations)
- **"change" event**: Trigger calculations after thumb release
- Prevents calculation storms, ensures clean initialization

**Impact**: HIGH - affects dashboard accuracy on load

**Priority**: HIGH (initialization accuracy critical)

---

#### **Bug #3: l_118 Number Format (LOW PRIORITY)**

**Symptom**: l_118 displays "3" instead of "3.00"

**Expected**: All editable numeric fields should use "number-2dp" format (3.00, 14.00, 2.66)

**Solution**: Ensure `refreshUI()` or initialization formatting applies "number-2dp" to l_118

**Impact**: Visual consistency only

**Priority**: LOW (doesn't affect calculations)

---

#### **Bug #4: S03 Location Change State Mixing (CRITICAL PRIORITY)** üö®

**Symptom**: Changing location at S03 (e.g., h_13 City dropdown) triggers recalculation of BOTH Target AND Reference states with the new location's weather data, instead of only the active mode.

**Expected Behavior**:
- In Target mode: Location change updates Target weather data (unprefixed: d_20, d_21, etc.) ONLY
- In Reference mode: Location change updates Reference weather data (ref_d_20, ref_d_21, etc.) ONLY
- Opposite mode should remain unchanged

**Current Behavior**: 
- Location change contaminates BOTH states simultaneously
- Both Target and Reference recalculate with new weather values
- Classic state mixing - the S03 issue is NOT RESOLVED

**Probable Root Causes**:

1. **S03 Publishing Pattern Contamination**:
   - S03 may be publishing weather data without mode awareness
   - Possible dual-publishing: writes both `d_20` AND `ref_d_20` on every location change
   - Or: Always publishes unprefixed values regardless of current mode
   - Check: Does S03 respect ModeManager.currentMode when publishing climate data?

2. **Downstream Consumer Contamination**:
   - S10, S11, S12, S13, S15 consume weather data from S03
   - These sections may have getRefValue() fallback contamination
   - Pattern B antipattern: Reading `ref_d_20` when mode is Target
   - Check: Do downstream getValue() calls use correct prefix per mode?

3. **StateManager Wildcard Listener Issue** (Known from Memory):
   - StateManager.setValue() with "calculated" state doesn't trigger wildcard listeners
   - S03 publishes climate data correctly but listeners never fire
   - Downstream sections read stale cached values
   - Orchestrator coordination required (SEPT15-RACE-MITIGATION.md pattern)

4. **S03 Field Definition Defaults**:
   - S03 may be using shared field defaults for both modes
   - Location change resets both TargetState AND ReferenceState to same defaults
   - Check: Are S03 dual-state objects properly separated?

**Direct Weather Data Consumers**:
- S10: Unknown dependencies (need to verify)
- S11: Climate data for envelope calculations
- S12: Climate data for system sizing
- S13: HDD (d_20), CDD (d_21) for heating/cooling
- S15: Climate data for aggregation

**Historical Context**: 
From Memory ID 8850660: "S03 publishes climate data perfectly (verified: d_20=7100 stored correctly), but downstream sections read stale cached values because listeners never fire."

**Impact**: CRITICAL - undermines entire dual-state architecture, prevents independent Target/Reference modeling

**Priority**: CRITICAL (must fix before g_118)

**Investigation Required**:
1. Add logging to S03 location change handler - which keys are published? With what prefixes?
2. Add logging to S10/S11/S12/S13/S15 climate data consumers - which keys are read? From which mode?
3. Check S03 ModeManager.currentMode usage - is it respected?
4. Review S03 TargetState/ReferenceState objects - are they properly isolated?
5. Check downstream getValue() calls - any getRefValue() fallbacks or Pattern B contamination?

#### **Bug #5: g_118 Ventilation Method State Mixing (THE FINAL BOSS)** üéØüíÄ

**Symptom**: Changing g_118 ventilation method dropdown causes state mixing between Target and Reference modes.

**Expected Behavior**:
- g_118 change in Target mode ‚Üí recalculates D120 (Target) ONLY ‚Üí cascades to H120, D121, M121 (Target)
- g_118 change in Reference mode ‚Üí recalculates ref_D120 ONLY ‚Üí cascades to ref_H120, ref_D121, ref_M121
- Opposite mode remains untouched

**Current Behavior**: 
- g_118 change contaminates both states (needs investigation to confirm exact pattern)
- Calculation cascade affects wrong mode
- State mixing across Target/Reference boundary

**Historical Context - THE GRAVEYARD**:

This single dropdown has **killed every S13 refactor attempt**:
- **March 2025**: Context objects introduced to fix g_118 ‚Üí state mixing
- **June 2025**: Cooling integration to fix g_118 ‚Üí calculation storms  
- **August 2025**: Pattern 2 migration to fix g_118 ‚Üí reference contamination
- **September 2025**: CHUNK pattern to fix g_118 ‚Üí timing errors

**Root Cause Pattern (Hypothesis)**:
1. **Listener Contamination**: 
   - g_118 listener may trigger `calculateAll()` without mode parameter
   - Or: Listener uses wrong mode (calculates Reference when Target is active)
   - Calculation cascade writes to both prefixed and unprefixed keys

2. **D120 Formula Mode Blindness**:
   - D120 calculation reads from multiple sources: L118, D105, I63, J63, D63, D119
   - If ANY of these reads use wrong prefix ‚Üí contamination spreads
   - Four different formulas based on g_118 value - each must be mode-aware

3. **Cascade Amplification**:
   - D120 ‚Üí H120 (annual heating) ‚Üí D121 (energy) ‚Üí M121 (CED)
   - Single contaminated read at D120 ‚Üí cascades through entire chain
   - Affects S13 downstream calculations (D122, D123, free cooling)

4. **Whackamole History**:
   - Previous fixes added listeners ‚Üí calculation storms
   - Previous fixes added mode checks ‚Üí broke other calculations
   - Previous fixes added orchestrator calls ‚Üí timing errors
   - **Why?** Because fix was applied without understanding full contamination path

**Probable Root Causes (Needs Investigation)**:

1. **g_118 Event Listener Issues**:
   - Listener doesn't check ModeManager.currentMode before calculating
   - Or: Listener calls calculateVentilationRates() which calculates BOTH modes
   - Or: Listener missing entirely (current Bug from line 354-366)

2. **calculateVentilationRates() Contamination**:
   - Function may not be mode-aware (no isReferenceCalculation parameter)
   - Reads unprefixed values even when should read ref_ values
   - Writes to both prefixed and unprefixed simultaneously

3. **Input Dependencies Not Mode-Isolated**:
   - L118, D105, I63, J63, D63, D119 - are all of these dual-state?
   - If ANY dependency is shared across modes ‚Üí contamination spreads
   - Need to verify each input has Target and Reference versions

4. **Pattern 1 vs Manual Mode Switching**:
   - S13 currently uses manual isReferenceCalculation parameters
   - Pattern 1 (temporary mode switching) might prevent contamination
   - But previous Pattern 1 migration attempts failed (see graveyard)

**Impact**: CRITICAL - This is the final boss. If we can't fix this, S13 refactor fails.

**Priority**: CRITICAL (but must fix Bug #4 first - S03 contamination may be upstream cause)

**Investigation Required** (BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES):
1. **Map the full chain**:
   - g_118 listener ‚Üí which function is called?
   - calculateVentilationRates() ‚Üí reads which keys? Writes which keys?
   - D120 cascade ‚Üí H120 ‚Üí D121 ‚Üí M121 (trace every getValue/setValue)
   - Are ALL reads mode-aware? Are ALL writes mode-aware?

2. **Check dual-state coverage**:
   - L118 - dual-state? ‚úì or ‚úó
   - D105 - dual-state? ‚úì or ‚úó  
   - I63/J63 - dual-state? ‚úì or ‚úó
   - D63 - dual-state? ‚úì or ‚úó
   - D119 - dual-state? ‚úì or ‚úó
   - If ANY are missing Reference versions ‚Üí contamination guaranteed

3. **Review previous fix attempts**:
   - What did March 2025 context objects try to solve?
   - What did June 2025 cooling integration break?
   - What did August/September attempts miss?
   - **Learn from the graveyard** - don't repeat failed patterns

4. **Test contamination pattern**:
   - Set Target g_118 to "Volume Constant"
   - Set Reference g_118 to "Occupant by Schedule"  
   - Change Target g_118 to "Volume by Schedule"
   - Does Reference D120 change? (it shouldn't)
   - Add logging to trace contamination path

**Critical Warning** (Memory ID 8749787):
> "The user prefers making code changes in small, methodical, testable chunks with clean, discrete commits. Each change should be tested before committing to avoid technical debt."

**DO NOT**:
- ‚ùå Add listeners without understanding full chain
- ‚ùå Add mode checks without verifying ALL dependencies are dual-state
- ‚ùå Rush to Pattern 1 migration (tried before, failed)
- ‚ùå Apply "quick fixes" that create whackamole

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Map every getValue/setValue call in ventilation chain
- ‚úÖ Verify dual-state coverage for ALL dependencies
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive logging to understand contamination path
- ‚úÖ Test one change at a time
- ‚úÖ Understand WHY previous attempts failed before trying new approach

**Hypothesis to Test**: Bug #4 (S03 contamination) may be the UPSTREAM cause of Bug #5. If S03 publishes climate data to both modes, then S13 ventilation calculations will contaminate because they're reading contaminated inputs. **Fix S03 first, then retest g_118.**

---

### **üìã NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES (REVISED):**

**Phase 1: Investigation (No Code Changes)**
1. **Investigate Bug #4** (S03 state mixing) - Map climate data publishing chain
2. **Investigate Bug #5** (g_118 state mixing) - Map ventilation calculation chain  
3. **Document findings** - Create contamination path diagrams

**Phase 2: Fixes (After Investigation Complete)**
4. **Fix Bug #4** (S03 state mixing) - CRITICAL, likely upstream cause
5. **Retest Bug #5** (g_118) - May be fixed by S03 fix, or reveal true root cause
6. **Fix Bug #2** (d_118 slider timing) - HIGH PRIORITY
7. **Fix Bug #1** (number format timing) - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
8. **Fix Bug #3** (l_118 formatting) - LOW PRIORITY

**Status**: Clean architecture achieved (9/9 CHEATSHEET), but state mixing remains in S03 (12-month known issue) and g_118 (refactor graveyard). INVESTIGATION REQUIRED BEFORE CODE CHANGES.

**Wisdom**: "Fools rush in" - understand the full contamination chain before attempting fixes. Previous g_118 repair attempts broke many other things and turned into endless whackamole. Learn from the graveyard. üíÄ
