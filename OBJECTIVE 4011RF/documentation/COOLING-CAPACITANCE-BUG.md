# COOLING-CAPACITANCE BUG

## Issue Summary
Reference mode cooling calculations are broken in two related ways:
1. **Capacitance toggle issue**: S03's capacitance toggle (h_21) has no effect in Reference mode, despite working perfectly in Target mode
2. **Zero cooling load**: S13 shows 0 cooling load in Reference mode (d_117) when cooling toggle (d_116) is enabled

## Symptoms

### Working in Target Mode
- S03 capacitance toggle (h_21) switches thermal absorption on/off
- Capacitance slider (i_21) controls 0-100% absorption
- S11 ground-facing elements (rows 94-95) show negative heat gain when capacitance is on
- S13 cooling calculations work correctly

### Broken in Reference Mode
- S03 capacitance toggle (h_21) appears to have no effect
- S11 ground-facing elements (k_94, k_95) DO update correctly (Reference ‚Üí Reference works)
- S13 cooling load (d_117) shows 0 when cooling toggle (d_116) is enabled
- Value chain breaks somewhere between S11 and S13

## Data Flow Analysis

### Expected Flow
```
S03 (h_21 toggle, i_21 slider)
  ‚Üì
S11 ground-facing opaque elements (rows 94-95)
  ‚Üí k_94: ground-facing heat gain
  ‚Üí k_95: ground-facing heat gain (with capacitance)
  ‚Üì
S13 cooling calculations
  ‚Üí d_116: cooling toggle
  ‚Üí d_117: reference cooling load
```

### Current Behavior
- ‚úÖ S03 Reference ‚Üí S11 Reference: WORKS
- ‚ùå S11 Reference ‚Üí S13 Reference: BREAKS

## Similar to g_101 Bug
This bug shares characteristics with our recent g_101 fix:
- Target mode works perfectly
- Reference mode breaks in the calculation chain
- Likely involves missing Reference mode state paths
- May involve fallback anti-patterns

## Investigation Plan

1. **S03 Analysis**
   - [ ] Read h_21 toggle implementation
   - [ ] Read i_21 slider implementation
   - [ ] Check Reference mode state paths
   - [ ] Verify publications to S11

2. **S11 Analysis**
   - [ ] Read k_94 and k_95 calculations
   - [ ] Check ground-facing element logic
   - [ ] Verify capacitance integration
   - [ ] Check publications to S13

3. **S13 Analysis** ‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREME CAUTION - MOST COMPLEX SECTION
   - [ ] Read d_116 cooling toggle implementation
   - [ ] Read d_117 cooling load calculation
   - [ ] Trace where S11 values are consumed
   - [ ] Check for Reference mode state paths
   - [ ] Look for fallback anti-patterns

4. **Root Cause Identification**
   - [ ] Identify where the chain breaks
   - [ ] Determine if issue is in S03, S11, S13, or bridging code
   - [ ] Check ReferenceManager for missing integrations

## Notes
- S13 is the MOST complex section file - proceed with extreme caution
- NO CODE CHANGES until analysis is complete
- May need to check StateManager, ReferenceManager, and bridging code

### Investigation Findings

#### 1. S03 Capacitance Implementation ‚úÖ
**Location**: [4012-Section03.js:1684-1700](../sections/4012-Section03.js#L1684-L1700)

- **h_21**: Dropdown toggle with options "Static" or "Capacitance"
- **i_21**: Percentage slider (0-100%) for capacitance factor
- **Calculation**: Ground-Facing CDD (h_22)
  - If h_21 = "Static": `MAX(0, (10 - TsetCool) * DaysCooling)`
  - If h_21 = "Capacitance": `(10 - TsetCool) * DaysCooling` (can be negative)

**Reference Mode Publishing**: ‚úÖ WORKS
- S03's `storeReferenceResults()` publishes `h_22` as `ref_h_22` to StateManager
- Location: [4012-Section03.js:1843](../sections/4012-Section03.js#L1843)

**Verdict**: S03 is working correctly for both Target and Reference modes.

---

#### 2. S11 Ground-Facing Elements ‚úÖ
**Location**: [4012-Section11.js:1453-1463](../sections/4012-Section11.js#L1453-L1463)

- **k_94**: Ground-facing slab heat gain (calculated)
- **k_95**: Ground-facing basement/crawl heat gain (calculated)
- **Formula**: Uses `capacitanceFactor_i21 * h_22 * 24` as heatgain multiplier

**Reference Mode Reading**: ‚úÖ WORKS
```javascript
if (isReferenceCalculation) {
  const ref_h22 = getGlobalNumericValue("ref_h_22") || 0;
  heatgainMultiplier = capacitanceFactor_i21 * ref_h22 * 24;
  console.log(`[S11] üîµ REF CLIMATE READ: h_22=${ref_h22}`);
}
```

**State Path Listeners**: ‚úÖ WORKS
- S11 has listeners for both `h_22` (Target) and `ref_h_22` (Reference)
- Location: [4012-Section11.js:2187, 2193](../sections/4012-Section11.js#L2187-L2193)

**Verdict**: S11 correctly reads `ref_h_22` from S03 and calculates ground-facing heat gains for Reference mode.

---

#### 3. S13 Cooling System - ROOT CAUSE FOUND üî¥

**Problem 1: Hardcoded "No Cooling" in ReferenceState**
**Location**: [4012-Section13.js:113](../sections/4012-Section13.js#L113)

```javascript
ReferenceState.initializeDefaults: function () {
  // ...
  this.state.d_116 = "No Cooling";  // üî¥ HARDCODED!
  // ...
}
```

This hardcoded value prevents Reference mode from EVER calculating cooling loads, regardless of user input.

**Problem 2: Cooling Load Calculation Logic**
**Location**: [4012-Section13.js:2438-2464](../sections/4012-Section13.js#L2438-L2464)

```javascript
const coolingSystemType = ModeManager.getValue("d_116") || "No Cooling";
// ...
if (coolingSystemType === "No Cooling") {
  coolingLoad_d117 = 0;  // üî¥ Always zero in Reference mode!
  coolingSink_l116 = 0;
  coolingSink_l114 = 0;
  j_116_display = 0;
}
```

**Why d_117 shows 0 in Reference mode**:
1. User toggles d_116 to "Cooling" in Reference mode UI
2. But ReferenceState.initializeDefaults() overrides it back to "No Cooling"
3. Cooling calculation reads "No Cooling" from ReferenceState
4. Sets d_117 = 0

---

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: S13 Reference Mode Configuration
The issue is NOT in S03 or S11. Both sections work perfectly. The problem is in **S13's ReferenceState initialization**.

**Why this matters**:
- Users need to test Cooling/No Cooling scenarios in the Reference model
- This bug prevents testing cooling scenarios in Reference mode
- It also means capacitance effects or indoor RH% (i_59)set in S08 on cooling cannot be observed in Reference mode

#### Capacitance Toggle Issue (h_21)
The capacitance toggle DOES work, but its effects cannot be seen in Reference mode because:
1. S03 ‚Üí S11 chain works perfectly
2. S11 calculates correct ground-facing heat gains (including negative values from capacitance)
3. BUT S13 Reference mode has d_116 = "No Cooling" hardcoded
4. So cooling calculations never run, and capacitance effects on cooling are invisible

---

### Decision Point: What Should We Fix?

#### Option 1: Allow User-Controlled Cooling in Reference Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Change**: Remove hardcoded `d_116 = "No Cooling"` from ReferenceState
**Pros**:
- Allows testing cooling scenarios in Reference mode
- Makes capacitance effects visible
- More flexible for "what-if" scenarios

**Cons**:
- **Breaks code compliance logic**
- Reference buildings per OBC/NBC have no mechanical cooling
- May confuse users about what "Reference" means
- Could produce invalid code compliance comparisons

#### Option 2: Keep Current Architecture, Document Limitation ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
**Change**: No code changes
**Action**: Document that Reference mode cooling is intentionally disabled per building codes

**Rationale**:
- Architecturally correct for code compliance
- Capacitance IS working - it affects heating calculations
- Reference buildings per codes don't have mechanical cooling
- Target mode is the correct place to test cooling scenarios with capacitance

#### Option 3: Create Hybrid Mode (Future Enhancement)
**Change**: Add new "Custom Reference" mode
**Scope**: Too large for current bug fix
**Deferred**: Document as future enhancement

---

### Root Cause Analysis - DEEPER INVESTIGATION NEEDED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This IS a bug** - a calculation parity failure between Target and Reference modes.

**Updated Findings from Logs.md**:

The issue is MORE COMPLEX than initially diagnosed:

1. **d_116 toggle DOES trigger calculations** ‚úÖ
   - `[FieldManager] Routed d_116=Cooling through sect13 ModeManager`
   - `[Cooling] üöÄ Starting cooling calculations (mode=reference)...`

2. **BUT cooling demand m_129 = 0** ‚ùå
   - When d_116 changes: `m_129_annual=0, E37_daily=0`
   - After g_118 "priming": `m_129_annual=44203.21, E37_daily=225.52`

3. **The real problem**:
   - Cooling calculations RUN, but `m_129` (cooling demand) is ZERO
   - Something in the calculation chain is not ready/available when d_116 changes
   - g_118 (ventilation method) change triggers a FULLER recalculation that properly updates m_129
   - This suggests m_129 depends on upstream values that aren't updated in the d_116 code path

**Initial Fix Attempts** (partial success):
- ‚úÖ Added d_116 to user-modified tracking
- ‚úÖ Removed mode check from ReferenceState.setValue calculations
- ‚ùå Still doesn't fully work - m_129 remains zero

**Why This Matters**:
- Building codes can include cooling systems in Reference buildings when the design includes cooling
- Users MUST be able to test Reference mode with cooling (calculation parity)
- The default "No Cooling" is correct for INITIAL state, but users should be able to override it
- This is the same pattern used for f_113 and j_115 (preserved user modifications)

---

### Next Steps for Investigation

**Questions to Answer**:

1. **Where is m_129 (cooling demand) calculated?**
   - Need to find the function that calculates cooling demand
   - Understand what inputs it needs
   - Check if those inputs are available when d_116 changes

2. **What does g_118 trigger that d_116 doesn't?**
   - g_118 change successfully "primes" the system
   - What additional recalculation does it trigger?
   - Is there a missing dependency or listener?

3. **Is m_129 calculated BEFORE the cooling load calculation?**
   - Perhaps m_129 needs to be calculated first
   - Then cooling load (d_117) uses m_129
   - Order of operations may be wrong in d_116 path

4. **Are there state listeners missing?**
   - Check if d_116 needs to publish/trigger additional state updates
   - Compare d_116 listeners vs g_118 listeners

## Debugging Strategy: console.trace() Approach

**Date:** October 18, 2025

### Relevance of d_12 State Mixing Bug Debugging Approach

The d_12 bug debugging approach (documented in [d_12-STATE-MIXING-DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md](history (completed)/d_12-STATE-MIXING-DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md)) used `console.trace()` to capture call stacks when mysterious state writes occurred.

**d_12 Bug Pattern:**
- Symptom: Unprefixed `d_12` being written when only `ref_d_12` should be written
- Mystery: Couldn't find WHERE the write was coming from
- Solution: Added `console.trace()` to StateManager.setValue() to capture full call stack
- Result: Revealed the "ghost writer" by showing exact function call chain

**Our m_129=0 Bug Pattern:**
- Symptom: m_129 calculates as 0 when triggered by d_116, but correctly when triggered by g_118
- Mystery: Can't find WHY m_129 calculation returns 0 in d_116 path
- Both paths trigger cooling calculations, but produce different results

### Applicability Assessment: ‚úÖ HIGHLY RELEVANT

**Similarities:**
1. **Mystery behavior**: Both bugs involve "something" happening (or not happening) with unclear origin
2. **Different code paths**: d_12 had multiple handlers; m_129 has d_116 vs g_118 trigger paths
3. **Logs show symptom but not cause**: Both show the RESULT (unprefixed write / m_129=0) but not the WHY

**Key Difference:**
- d_12 bug: Needed to find WHO was calling a function
- m_129 bug: Need to understand WHY a calculation returns 0

### Proposed Debugging Approach

Add strategic `console.trace()` calls to trace the m_129 calculation path:

#### 1. Trace m_129 Calculation Origin
```javascript
// In S13 where m_129 is calculated
if (m_129 === 0 || m_129_annual === 0) {
  console.log(`[DEBUG m_129] Calculated as ZERO: m_129=${m_129}, m_129_annual=${m_129_annual}`);
  console.trace("Call stack when m_129=0:");
}
```

#### 2. Trace Critical Input Values
```javascript
// Where cooling demand inputs are gathered
console.log(`[DEBUG m_129 INPUTS] mode=${mode}, coolingSystemType=${coolingSystemType}`);
console.log(`[DEBUG m_129 INPUTS] S11 values: k_94=${k_94}, k_95=${k_95}`);
console.log(`[DEBUG m_129 INPUTS] Climate: CDD=${CDD}, capacitance=${capacitanceFactor}`);
if (someValueIsZeroOrMissing) {
  console.trace("Call stack when critical input is missing:");
}
```

#### 3. Compare d_116 vs g_118 Paths
```javascript
// In d_116 handler
console.log(`[DEBUG TRIGGER] d_116 changed to: ${value}`);
console.trace("d_116 trigger path:");

// In g_118 handler
console.log(`[DEBUG TRIGGER] g_118 changed to: ${value}`);
console.trace("g_118 trigger path:");
```

### Expected Insights

This approach should reveal:

1. **Call Stack Differences**: Why g_118 path has m_129>0 but d_116 path has m_129=0
2. **Calculation Order**: Whether m_129 is calculated before needed inputs are ready
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Which upstream values are 0/undefined in d_116 path but available in g_118 path
4. **Listener Chain**: Which recalculations fire in g_118 path but not d_116 path

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Add traces to S13 m_129 calculation** - Capture when it returns 0
2. **Add traces to d_116 and g_118 handlers** - Compare trigger paths
3. **Test both scenarios**:
   - Toggle d_116: "No Cooling" ‚Üí "Cooling" (captures m_129=0 path)
   - Change g_118: Any value change (captures m_129>0 path)
4. **Compare stack traces** - Identify where paths diverge

### Success Criteria

When we see the stack traces, we should be able to answer:
- What functions are called in g_118 path that aren't called in d_116 path?
- Are there intermediate calculation steps that d_116 path skips?
- Does m_129 calculation depend on values that g_118 updates but d_116 doesn't?

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - October 18, 2025

### THE ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: Cooling.js Initialization Flaw ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Target vs Reference Calculation Parity Violation**

After tracing why Target mode works perfectly but Reference mode fails, the root cause is found in **Cooling.js initialization**:

**Location**: [4012-Cooling.js:693-747](../4012-Cooling.js#L693-L747)

```javascript
function initialize(params = {}) {
  // Try to get values from StateManager if available
  if (typeof window.TEUI.StateManager !== "undefined") {
    // ‚ùå BUG: Reads ONLY unprefixed values (Target mode)
    const coolingSetpoint = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("h_24"); // NO ref_ prefix
    state.coolingSetTemp = coolingSetpoint ? parseFloat(coolingSetpoint) : 24;

    const cdd = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("d_21"); // NO ref_ prefix
    state.coolingDegreeDays = cdd ? parseFloat(cdd) : 196;

    const volume = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("d_105"); // NO ref_ prefix
    state.buildingVolume = volume ? parseFloat(volume.toString().replace(/,/g, "")) : 8000;

    const area = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("h_15"); // NO ref_ prefix
    state.buildingArea = area ? parseFloat(area.toString().replace(/,/g, "")) : 1427.2;

    const indoorRH = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("i_59"); // NO ref_ prefix
    state.indoorRH = indoorRH ? parseFloat(indoorRH) / 100 : 0.45;
  }

  // ‚ùå BUG: Only calculates Target mode on initialization
  calculateAll("target");

  state.initialized = true;
}
```

### Why Target Mode Works Perfectly

**Target mode initialization flow:**
1. App loads ‚Üí StateManager populated with S02/S03/S08/S12 values
2. Cooling.js `initialize()` runs ‚Üí reads unprefixed values ‚úÖ
3. Calls `calculateAll("target")` ‚Üí populates Target cooling values ‚úÖ
4. User toggles d_116 ‚Üí S13 calls `CoolingCalculations.calculateAll("target")` ‚úÖ
5. Cooling.js reads fresh values via `getModeAwareValue()` (no prefix) ‚úÖ
6. **Everything works because Target values were initialized and exist**

### Why Reference Mode Fails

**Reference mode "cold start" flow:**
1. App loads ‚Üí StateManager populated with **unprefixed** values only
2. Cooling.js `initialize()` runs ‚Üí reads unprefixed values (Target)
3. Calls `calculateAll("target")` ‚Üí **NEVER calls with "reference"** ‚ùå
4. User switches to Reference mode ‚Üí Changes d_116 to "Cooling"
5. S13 calls `CoolingCalculations.calculateAll("reference")`
6. Cooling.js tries to read `ref_h_24`, `ref_d_21`, `ref_d_105`, `ref_h_15`, `ref_i_59`
7. **ALL RETURN NULL - Reference values were NEVER initialized** ‚ùå
8. Falls back to defaults or 0 ‚Üí m_129 = 0 ‚ùå

**After g_118 "priming":**
1. g_118 change triggers `Calculator.calculateAll()`
2. **Full cascade runs S02 ‚Üí S03 ‚Üí S08 ‚Üí S12**
3. These sections publish `ref_` prefixed values to StateManager ‚úÖ
4. NOW when Cooling.js calls `getModeAwareValue()`, `ref_*` values exist ‚úÖ
5. m_129 calculates correctly ‚úÖ

### The Smoking Gun (Secondary Issue)

**Location**: [4012-Section13.js:2234-2244](../sections/4012-Section13.js#L2234-L2244)

```javascript
// üîß FIX (Oct 7, 2025): Force complete calculator cascade when g_118 changes
// This ensures cooling calculations get proper climate/volume/area values
// which are initialized during full Calculator.calculateAll() but not S13-only calcs
if (fieldId === "g_118") {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();  // ‚Üê THIS IS THE "PRIMING"!
    }
  }, 50); // Small delay ensures S13 values published first
}
```

### What This Reveals

**g_118 "priming" works because**:
- g_118 change calls `calculateAll()` (local S13 calculations)
- THEN calls `window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll()` (FULL cascade across ALL sections)
- The full cascade populates upstream values (from S03/S08/S11) that m_129 needs
- Those values persist in StateManager, making subsequent changes work

**d_116 fails because**:
- d_116 change calls `calculateAll()` (local S13 calculations only)
- Does NOT call `Calculator.calculateAll()` (no full cascade)
- Upstream dependencies (climate data, building volume, area, humidity) aren't ready
- m_129 calculation reads zeros/nulls from StateManager ‚Üí returns 0

### The Dependency Chain

m_129 (cooling demand) depends on values calculated in **other sections**:

1. **4012-Cooling.js** needs:
   - `d_105` (building volume) from S12
   - `h_15` (building area) from S02
   - `d_21` (CDD) from S03
   - `h_24` (cooling setpoint) from S03
   - `i_59` (indoor RH%) from S08

2. **Without full cascade**:
   - These values are null/0 in Cooling.js state
   - Latent load factor = 0
   - Free cooling limit = 0
   - m_129 = 0

3. **With full cascade** (g_118 path):
   - Calculator.calculateAll() runs S02 ‚Üí S03 ‚Üí S08 ‚Üí S12 ‚Üí S13
   - All upstream values populate correctly
   - Cooling.js gets valid inputs
   - m_129 calculates correctly

### Why "Laggy" After Priming

After g_118 priming, the values exist in StateManager state. But:
- Changes to capacitance (h_21) or humidity (i_59) only trigger their local section
- Those sections publish to StateManager
- But Cooling.js doesn't recalculate unless triggered
- Values appear "laggy" because the dependency chain is incomplete

### The Fix (Surgical Approach)

**Option 1: Add Calculator.calculateAll() to d_116 handler** ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKY
- Copy the g_118 pattern to d_116
- Could cause performance issues (full cascade on every cooling toggle)
- May have side effects we haven't discovered

**Option 2: Add proper dependency listeners to Cooling.js** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- Cooling.js should listen for changes to its dependencies
- When h_15, d_21, h_24, i_59, etc. change ‚Üí recalculate
- More targeted, less risky
- Follows proper dependency management pattern

**Option 3: Ensure Calculator.calculateAll() runs on app load** ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- Verify full cascade runs during initialization
- Ensures all values populated before user interactions
- Prevents the "need to prime" issue on first use

### CALCULATION PARITY FIX: Ensure Reference Values Are Initialized

The proper fix that achieves **calculation parity with Target mode** requires ensuring Reference values exist in StateManager before Cooling.js needs them.

#### Option 1: Ensure Calculator.calculateAll() Runs on App Initialization ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**Why g_118 "priming" works**: It triggers `Calculator.calculateAll()` which runs the full cascade S02‚ÜíS03‚ÜíS08‚ÜíS12, populating ALL `ref_*` values.

**The Fix**: Ensure this cascade happens **BEFORE** user interactions, not as a workaround.

**Code Change**: [4011-Calculator.js](../4011-Calculator.js) or initialization sequence

Verify that on app load:
1. Calculator.calculateAll() runs (it does - see line 519)
2. It calculates **BOTH** Target AND Reference models
3. All sections publish ref_* values to StateManager
4. **THEN** Cooling.js initializes

**Current Issue**: Cooling.js might initialize before Calculator runs the full cascade.

**Test**: Check initialization sequence in console logs:
```
[Calculator] Running calculateAll...
[Section02] Publishing ref_h_15...
[Section03] Publishing ref_d_21, ref_h_24...
[Section08] Publishing ref_i_59...
[Section12] Publishing ref_d_105...
[Cooling] Initializing...  ‚Üê Should come AFTER ref_ values exist
```

#### Option 2: Add Calculator.calculateAll() to d_116 Handler (Workaround)

**This is a WORKAROUND, not the root fix**. It papers over the initialization problem.

**Code Change**: [4012-Section13.js:2234-2244](../sections/4012-Section13.js#L2234-L2244)

```javascript
// üîß FIX (Oct 7, 2025): Force complete calculator cascade when g_118 changes
if (fieldId === "g_118") {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();
    }
  }, 50);
}

// üîß WORKAROUND (Oct 18, 2025): Apply same cascade to d_116
// NOTE: This is a workaround for Cooling.js initialization issue
// Proper fix is to ensure ref_ values exist before Cooling.js initializes
if (fieldId === "d_116") {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();
    }
  }, 50);
}
```

**Why this is a workaround:**
- ‚ùå Triggers full cascade on every d_116 change (performance hit)
- ‚ùå Doesn't fix the root cause (initialization order)
- ‚ùå Doesn't achieve calculation parity (different code paths)
- ‚ùå Still has "laggy" behavior for h_21, i_59 changes

#### Option 3: Fix Cooling.js to Not Require Pre-initialization ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURAL FIX

**The Target Way**: Target mode doesn't need values pre-initialized because unprefixed values always exist in StateManager.

**Make Reference mode work the same way**:

**Code Change**: [4012-Cooling.js:693-747](../4012-Cooling.js#L693-L747)

Remove initialization dependency on StateManager values - let `calculateAll(mode)` read fresh values each time:

```javascript
function initialize(params = {}) {
  // ‚ùå REMOVE: Don't pre-load values during init
  // Let calculateAll() read fresh values mode-aware each time

  // Register with StateManager
  registerWithStateManager();

  // ‚úÖ NEW: Run initial calculations for BOTH modes
  calculateAll("target");   // Initialize Target cooling values
  calculateAll("reference"); // Initialize Reference cooling values

  state.initialized = true;
}
```

**Why This Achieves Parity:**
1. ‚úÖ Both modes initialized equally
2. ‚úÖ No dependency on pre-existing ref_ values
3. ‚úÖ calculateAll() always reads fresh via getModeAwareValue()
4. ‚úÖ Same code path for both modes
5. ‚úÖ No workarounds needed in S13
6. ‚úÖ Matches Target mode architecture exactly

## CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING - October 18, 2025

### The "m_129 = 0" Was NOT a Bug! ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical Realization**: We were chasing a phantom bug.

**Why m_129 = 0 is CORRECT behavior**:
- When Ventilation = "Constant Volume" (default setting)
- Free cooling from ventilation provides 100% cooling capacity
- Mechanical cooling load legitimately = 0
- **This is working as designed!** ‚úÖ

**From Logs.md**:
```
[Cooling m_124 COOLING-TARGET] m_129_annual=0, E37_daily=0  ‚Üê CORRECT when free cooling = 100%
```

### What ARE the Real Bugs?

The actual user-reported issues are **NOT about m_129 = 0**. They are:

1. ‚ùå **Capacitance toggle (h_21) doesn't affect cooling calculations in Reference mode (S03)**
2. ‚ùå **Indoor RH% slider (i_59) doesn't affect cooling calculations in Reference mode (S08)**

These are likely **input routing issues** - user changes in Reference mode aren't:
- Being routed to Reference state correctly, OR
- Triggering Reference recalculations, OR
- Being read by cooling calculations

### Proper Test Scenario

To test cooling bugs, use a scenario where mechanical cooling IS needed:

**Setup**:
- Heating system: Electricity (triggers cooling in Reference)
- Cooling system: Cooling (enabled)
- Ventilation: Volume by Schedule (NOT constant - reduces free cooling)

**Then test**:
- Change capacitance (h_21) ‚Üí should affect cooling load
- Change indoor RH% (i_59) ‚Üí should affect latent cooling load

### Investigation Path Forward

1. **Test proper scenario** (Elec + Cooling + Scheduled vent)
2. **Verify m_129 > 0** (mechanical cooling needed)
3. **Test h_21 capacitance** in Reference mode - does it recalculate?
4. **Test i_59 RH%** in Reference mode - does it recalculate?
5. **Use console.trace()** if inputs aren't routing correctly

### Lessons Learned

- ‚ùå Don't assume m_129=0 is a bug without understanding physics
- ‚ùå Don't implement "fixes" before confirming the symptom is actually wrong behavior
- ‚úÖ Test with proper scenarios where the effect SHOULD be visible
- ‚úÖ Understand the domain (free cooling can eliminate mechanical cooling need)

### Investigation Status

**All S13 changes REVERTED** ‚úÖ
- Initial fixes did not address the root cause
- Avoided technical debt from non-functional changes
- Clean slate for proper diagnosis

**The ACTUAL problem** (confirmed from logs):
- m_129 (cooling demand) is calculated as **ZERO** in S13 Reference mode
- This happens INSIDE S13 calculations, not a state management issue
- m_129 should be immediately available to S13 without going through StateManager
- When S14 shows m_129 = 0, it's because S13 calculated it as zero

### Previous Fix Attempts (REVERTED)

These were attempted but reverted as they didn't fix m_129=0:

**Two changes that were made to S13 ReferenceState** ([4012-Section13.js](../sections/4012-Section13.js)):

#### 1. Track d_116_userModified flag (line 158)
```javascript
// Mark fields as user-modified to preserve during d_13 changes
if (
  source === "user-modified" &&
  (fieldId === "f_113" || fieldId === "j_115" || fieldId === "d_116")  // ‚Üê Added d_116
) {
  this.state[`${fieldId}_userModified`] = true;
}
```

#### 2. Preserve user modifications in setDefaults() (line 127-130)
```javascript
// üîß FIX: Preserve user's cooling system choice (calculation parity)
if (!this.state.d_116_userModified) {
  this.state.d_116 = "No Cooling"; // Default per building codes
}
```

#### 3. Preserve user modifications in onReferenceStandardChange() (line 159-162)
```javascript
// üîß FIX: Preserve user's cooling system choice (calculation parity)
if (!this.state.d_116_userModified) {
  this.state.d_116 = "No Cooling"; // Default per building codes
}
```

#### 4. Load saved state to preserve across sessions (line 107-117)
```javascript
// Step 1: Load saved state if exists (to preserve user modifications)
const savedState = localStorage.getItem("S13_REFERENCE_STATE");
if (savedState) {
  try {
    this.state = JSON.parse(savedState);
  } catch (e) {
    this.state = {};
  }
} else {
  this.state = {};
}
```

---

### Result

**Calculation Dis-Parity Restored** ‚úÖ

Target mode works, Reference does not:
- Default: "No Cooling" 
- User can toggle to "Cooling" and it PERSISTS
- Cooling calculations run correctly in Reference mode only when 'primed' by selecting g_118 method change to something else then back again
- Capacitance effects on cooling are not visible in Reference mode
- User modifications survive state refreshes

---

### Testing Recommendations

1. Switch to Reference mode
2. Toggle d_116 from "No Cooling" to "Cooling"
3. Verify d_117 shows non-zero cooling load
4. Change building code (d_13) and verify d_116 stays "Cooling"
5. Test capacitance (h_21) toggle and verify effects appear in k_94, k_95, and cooling calcs
