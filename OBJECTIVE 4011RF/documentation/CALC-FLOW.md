# Reference Mode Calculation Flow Regression

## üö® Critical Issue - Post-Import Reference Mode Blocked

**Date Discovered**: October 22, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH - Reference mode calculations broken after file import
**Status**: INVESTIGATING

---

## Symptom Summary

**Target Mode**: ‚úÖ Works correctly in all scenarios
**Reference Mode After Initialization**: ‚úÖ Works correctly
**Reference Mode After File Import**: ‚ùå BROKEN - calculations don't flow through system

### Working Sections (Reference Mode After Import)
- ‚úÖ **S03** - Climate data
- ‚úÖ **S07** - Water Use
- ‚úÖ **S13** - Mechanical Loads

### Broken Sections (Reference Mode After Import)
- ‚ùå **S10** - Radiant Gains (user changes don't propagate)
- ‚ùå **S11** - Transmission Losses (TB% slider changes don't propagate)
- ‚ùå **S12** - Volume Metrics (user changes don't propagate)

**Pattern**: S10, S11, S12 are sequential dependencies. Changes made in these sections update their own internal calculations but **do not flow downstream** to other sections.

---

## Reproduction Steps

### Scenario 1: Initialization (WORKS ‚úÖ)
1. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Click "Initialize" button
3. Navigate to S11
4. Switch to Reference mode
5. Change TB% slider from 0% to 20%
6. **Result**: ‚úÖ Changes flow through ‚Üí S12 updates ‚Üí downstream sections update ‚Üí e_10 updates

### Scenario 2: After Import (BROKEN ‚ùå)
1. Hard refresh page
2. Import Excel file
3. Navigate to S11
4. Switch to Reference mode
5. Change TB% slider from 0% to 20%
6. **Result**: ‚ùå S11 updates internally, but NO downstream propagation ‚Üí e_10 does NOT update

### Scenario 3: S12 After Import (BROKEN ‚ùå)
1. Import Excel file
2. Navigate to S12
3. Switch to Reference mode
4. Change d_103 (Stories) or g_109 (ACH50)
5. **Result**: ‚ùå S12 updates internally, but NO downstream propagation

## Technical Context

### What Changed Recently

**Commit `38da9c6`**: Removed self-listeners in S12
- **Intent**: Fix double calculation issue
- **Change**: Removed StateManager listeners for S12's own input fields
- **Reason**: Following S07 pattern where user edits trigger calculations directly

**Question**: Did removing self-listeners break something in the import flow?

### Key Differences: Init vs Import

#### Initialization Flow
1. `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs
2. Each section's `calculateAll()` runs both engines
3. Results published to StateManager
4. Listeners trigger dependent sections
5. ‚úÖ Full calculation chain completes

#### Import Flow
1. Quarantine listeners (muted)
2. Import Target values ‚Üí StateManager
3. Import Reference values ‚Üí StateManager
4. `syncPatternASections()` - sections sync from StateManager
5. Unquarantine listeners (unmuted)
6. `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs
7. ‚ùì **Something different happens here**

---

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Listener Muting Issue
**Theory**: Import process mutes listeners, and they don't properly re-engage for Reference mode after unmuting.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Check if `ref_*` value changes during import trigger listeners
- Verify listener registration state after import completes

### Hypothesis 2: State Contamination During Import
**Theory**: Import process populates states in a way that breaks the calculation chain for Reference mode.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Compare state of `ReferenceState` after init vs after import
- Check if `ref_*` values are properly published to StateManager during import

### Hypothesis 3: Double Calculation Prevention Gone Wrong
**Theory**: Removing self-listeners in S12 (commit `38da9c6`) broke something specific to the import flow.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Test if reverting `38da9c6` fixes the issue
- Compare S07 (working) vs S12 (broken) listener patterns

### Hypothesis 4: ModeManager.setValue() Publishing Issue
**Theory**: After import, `ModeManager.setValue()` might not be publishing `ref_*` values correctly.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Add console logging to `ModeManager.setValue()` in S11, S12
- Check if `ref_*` values are being published when user edits in Reference mode
- Verify StateManager receives the updates

---

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Console Logging)
1. Add logging to S11's `ModeManager.setValue()` to see if it publishes `ref_d_97` when TB% changes
2. Add logging to S12's `ModeManager.setValue()` to see if it publishes `ref_g_109` when ACH50 changes
3. Add logging to `StateManager.setValue()` to see what's being published
4. Test both init and import scenarios, compare logs

### Phase 2: Listener Verification
1. Check if `ref_*` listeners exist and are registered after import
2. Verify listeners fire when `ref_*` values change
3. Compare listener behavior init vs import

### Phase 3: Calculation Chain Trace
1. Add detailed logging to `calculateAll()` in S11, S12
2. Log when both engines run
3. Log what results are published to StateManager
4. Trace why downstream sections don't see the changes

### Phase 4: Root Cause Identification
Based on logging evidence, identify:
- Where the calculation chain breaks
- Why it works after init but not after import
- What specific change caused the regression

---

## Expected Behavior

When user changes a value in Reference mode (after init OR after import):

1. `handleFieldBlur` fires
2. `ModeManager.setValue(fieldId, value)` publishes `ref_fieldId` to StateManager
3. `handleFieldBlur` calls `calculateAll()`
4. Both engines run (Target + Reference)
5. Results published to StateManager (both unprefixed + `ref_` prefixed)
6. Downstream sections' listeners see changes
7. Downstream sections recalculate
8. Full chain completes ‚Üí e_10 updates

**Current Reality After Import**: Steps 1-5 work, but steps 6-8 fail.

---

## Next Steps

1. Create diagnostic logging in key sections
2. Test init scenario - capture logs
3. Test import scenario - capture logs
4. Compare and identify divergence point
5. Fix root cause
6. Verify fix works for both init and import

## Test Results

### Test 1: INITIALIZATION BASELINE (Working ‚úÖ)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test**: Change d_103 (Stories) from 1 to 1.5 in Reference mode after initialization

**Initial State**: e_10 = 287.0
**After Change**: e_10 = 289.9 ‚úÖ (Updated correctly!)
**Target h_10**: No change (correct - only Reference engine should update)

**S12 Diagnostic Logs (Key Events)**:
```
[S12 DIAG] setValue in REFERENCE mode: ref_d_103 = 1.5 (source=user-modified)
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Published ref_d_103 to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] setValue in REFERENCE mode: ref_d_103 = 1.5 (source=user-modified)
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Published ref_d_103 to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll START (mode=reference) ==========
[S12 DIAG] Running Reference engine...
[S12 DIAG] Running Target engine...
[S12 DIAG] Re-publishing 34 Reference results...
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Reference results re-published to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll END ==========
```

**Analysis**:
1. ‚úÖ `ref_d_103` published to StateManager (appears twice - likely dropdown change event)
2. ‚úÖ `calculateAll()` runs in reference mode
3. ‚úÖ Both engines execute (dual-engine architecture working)
4. ‚úÖ 34 Reference results re-published to StateManager
5. ‚úÖ **Downstream propagation works** - e_10 updates from 287.0 ‚Üí 289.9
6. ‚úÖ Target values unaffected (h_10 no change)

**Conclusion**: After initialization, Reference mode calculation flow works perfectly. All values publish correctly and downstream sections respond to changes.

### Test 2: POST-IMPORT (BROKEN ‚ùå)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test**: Same as Test 1, but after Excel file import instead of initialization

**Initial State**: e_10 = 910.8
**After Change**: Changed d_103 from 2 to 1.5 in Reference mode
**Result**: e_10 remains 910.8 ‚ùå (NO propagation!)

**S12 Diagnostic Logs**: IDENTICAL to Test 1! ‚úÖ

**Critical Finding**:
S12's behavior is **identical** in both scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Publishes `ref_d_103` to StateManager
- ‚úÖ Runs both engines (Reference + Target)
- ‚úÖ Re-publishes 34 Reference results to StateManager

**The Problem is DOWNSTREAM**: Other sections (S13, S14, S04, S01) are not responding to S12's published values after import.

---

## Phase 2: Expanded Diagnostic Logging (Commit `ccc5fe0`)

**Objective**: Track the full calculation chain to identify where propagation breaks after import.

**New Logging Added**:

### Calculator.js (4011-Calculator.js)
```
[CALC-FLOW] üéØ Calculator.calculateAll() START
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect12.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect12.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect13.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect13.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect14.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect14.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect04.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect04.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect01.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect01.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ Calculator.calculateAll() END
```

### Section 13 (4012-Section13.js)
```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S13.calculateAll() START (mode=reference)
[CALC-FLOW] üì§ S13 re-publishing N Reference results...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ S13 Reference results published to StateManager
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ S13.calculateAll() END
```

### Section 04 (4012-Section04.js)
```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S04.calculateAll() START (mode=reference)
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ S04.calculateAll() END (ref_j_32=VALUE)
```

### Section 01 (4012-Section01.js)
```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S01.updateTEUIDisplay() reading ref_j_32=VALUE, ref_h_15=VALUE
```

**What to Look For in Test 3**:
1. Does `Calculator.calculateAll()` run after S12 user edit?
2. Do all sections (S13, S14, S04, S01) execute?
3. Does S13 re-publish Reference results in Reference mode?
4. What is the `ref_j_32` value at S04 output?
5. What `ref_j_32` value does S01 read?
6. Are the values flowing through the chain, or stuck somewhere?

---

### Test 3: POST-IMPORT WITH EXPANDED LOGGING (Pending)

**Test Protocol**:
1. Hard refresh page
2. Import Excel file
3. Navigate to S12
4. Switch to Reference mode
5. Change d_103 from 2 to 1.5
6. Observe console for `[CALC-FLOW]` logs
7. Check if e_10 updates

**Expected Behavior**:
- After init: Full chain executes, e_10 updates ‚úÖ
- After import: Full chain executes but e_10 doesn't update ‚ùå

**Key Question**: At which point in the chain do the values stop propagating?

*Results pending...*
