# ðŸš¨ **DOCUMENTATION MOVED**

## **Current Documentation Location**

This file has been replaced with clean, actionable documentation:

- **Primary Guide**: `4012-CLEAN-REFACTOR-GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- **Quick Reference**: `4012-QUICK-PATTERNS.md` - Essential patterns for daily use
- **Architecture**: `../OBJECTIVE 4012/documentation/ARCHITECTURE-COMPARISON.md` - Design principles

## **Why This Change**

The original document was too verbose and repetitive for practical use. The new documentation is:
- âœ… **Concise** - Essential information only
- âœ… **Actionable** - Clear patterns and examples  
- âœ… **Up-to-date** - Reflects completed dual-state architecture
- âœ… **Agent-friendly** - Easy for future agents to understand

## ðŸ“‹ **Architecture Summary**

**Status**: âœ… **MILESTONE COMPLETE** - All 15 calculation sections (S01-S15) converted to dual-state tuples-based system with complete state isolation.

**Template**: Use `sections/4011-Section03.js` as the canonical pattern for any future development.

**Key Achievement**: Target h_10 remains stable at 93.6 regardless of Reference toggle changes - no more state contamination.

**Critical Pattern**: Sections that read other sections' outputs (like S15) must use mode-aware reading with prefixed values.
