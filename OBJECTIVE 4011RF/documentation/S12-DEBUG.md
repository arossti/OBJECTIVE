# S12 Reference Mode Display Bug - k_104 Field

## Bug Summary
S12's `k_104` field shows incorrect value `-4267.63` in Reference mode on initialization/import, even though S11's `ref_k_98` shows the correct value `-1895.40` in the DOM when S11 is switched to Reference mode.

## Symptoms
1. **Initial State (after hard refresh or file import)**:
   - Navigate to S12
   - Switch to Reference mode
   - Field `k_104` displays: `-4267.63` ❌ (WRONG)

2. **S11 shows correct value**:
   - Navigate to S11
   - Switch to Reference mode
   - Field `k_98` displays: `-1895.40` ✅ (CORRECT in DOM)

3. **Bug self-corrects after "priming"**:
   - Any change to S12 field (e.g., change Stories from 1 to 1.5 and back to 1)
   - OR change TB% slider in S11 while in Reference mode
   - Result: `k_104` now displays correct value `-1895.40` ✅

## Reproduction Steps
1. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Click "Initialize" button
3. Navigate to Section 12
4. Switch to "Reference" mode using toggle
5. Observe `k_104` field → shows `-4267.63` (incorrect)
6. Navigate to Section 11, switch to Reference mode → observe `k_98` shows `-1895.40` (correct)
7. Return to S12, change any field (e.g., Stories slider)
8. Observe `k_104` field → now shows `-1895.40` (correct)

## Technical Context

### Excel Formula Reference
S12 cell K104: `=IF(H21="Capacitance", K98, SUM(K101:K102))`
- When `h_21 = "Capacitance"`, `k_104` should equal S11's `k_98` value

### Data Flow (Reference Mode)
```
S03 → publishes ref_i_21 (capacitance %)
  ↓
S11 → reads ref_i_21 → calculates ref_k_98 → publishes to StateManager
  ↓
S12 → reads ref_k_98 from StateManager → displays as k_104
```

### Code Location
- **S12 reads ref_k_98**: [4012-Section12.js:2109-2123](../sections/4012-Section12.js)
- **S11 publishes ref_k_98**: [4012-Section11.js:1718-1722](../sections/4012-Section11.js)
- **S03 publishes ref_i_21**: [4012-Section03.js:1864-1877](../sections/4012-Section03.js)
- **S12 DOM update**: [4012-Section12.js:210-301](../sections/4012-Section12.js) (`updateCalculatedDisplayValues`)

## Key Observations

1. **StateManager vs DOM Discrepancy**:
   - S11 DOM shows correct value `-1895.40` in Reference mode
   - But S12 reads `-4267.63` from StateManager initially
   - This suggests StateManager contains stale/wrong value on initialization

2. **"Priming" Behavior**:
   - Any user interaction in S12 OR S11 (Reference mode) fixes the display
   - Suggests the calculation CAN work correctly, but initialization order is wrong

3. **Value Analysis**:
   - Incorrect value `-4267.63` suggests S11 calculated with `ref_i_21 = 0` or missing
   - Correct value `-1895.40` suggests S11 calculated with `ref_i_21 = 50` (correct)
   - Formula difference implies ground heat gain calculation uses capacitance factor

4. **🚨 CRITICAL: Only k_104 is Affected!**:
   - **ALL OTHER S12 fields display correctly in Reference mode**
   - Many other S12 fields also read from S11 (e.g., envelope areas, heat losses)
   - Those fields work perfectly on initialization
   - **ONLY `k_104` shows wrong value initially**
   - This suggests the bug is NOT a general S11→S12 data flow issue
   - The bug is SPECIFIC to the `k_104` field calculation or display logic

## Previous Investigation Attempts

### Attempt 1: Listener-based Solution
- Added listener in S12 for `ref_k_98` changes
- Result: Listener never fired (wrong architectural approach)
- Reverted: Listener spaghetti doesn't solve initialization timing

### Attempt 2: Orchestrator Dependency Management
- Updated [4012-Orchestrator.js](../4012-Orchestrator.js) with S03 → S11 → S12 dependency chain
- Result: Orchestrator exists but isn't actively used by the application
- Reverted: Overengineered solution for simple display bug

### Attempt 3: DOM Update After Reference Calculation
- Added `ModeManager.updateCalculatedDisplayValues()` call at end of S12's `calculateReferenceModel()`
- Result: Still showing incorrect value on initialization
- Status: Current state in codebase

## Architectural Notes

### Dual-State Architecture
- **Target State**: User's design values
- **Reference State**: Building code compliance values
- Each section has `TargetState` and `ReferenceState` internal state
- StateManager stores global cross-section values with `ref_` prefix for Reference mode

### Pattern A (S12 follows this)
- Sections maintain sovereign state
- Publish calculated results to StateManager for downstream sections
- Read upstream values from StateManager

### StateManager Listener Behavior
- Line 546-566 in [4011-StateManager.js](../4011-StateManager.js)
- Only fires listeners if value OR state changed (line 418-419)
- If `ref_k_98` doesn't change, listeners won't fire

## Questions for Next Investigation

1. **Why ONLY k_104?**:
   - What's different about `k_104` vs other S12 fields that read from S11?
   - Does `k_104` use a different read/display mechanism?
   - Is there special handling for `k_104` in the code?

2. **k_104 Specific Logic**:
   - Check S12's `calculateEnvelopeTotals()` function - how is `k_104` calculated?
   - Is there a conditional formula: `IF(h_21="Capacitance", k_98, SUM(k_101:k_102))`?
   - Does this conditional cause different behavior vs other fields?

3. **Timing Questions**:
   - When does `h_21` get set to "Capacitance" in Reference mode?
   - Does `k_104` calculation run BEFORE `h_21` is set correctly?
   - Is there a race condition in the conditional logic?

4. **StateManager vs Internal State**:
   - Does S12 calculate `k_104` and store to internal state correctly?
   - Is the bug in calculating OR in reading from StateManager OR in displaying to DOM?
   - Why does S11's DOM show correct `k_98` but S12 reads wrong value from StateManager?

## Debugging Strategy for Next Agent

### Step 1: Add Diagnostic Logging
Add console logs at these critical points:
```javascript
// S03 - after publishing ref_i_21
console.log(`[S03] Published ref_i_21 = ${value}`);

// S11 - when reading ref_i_21
const ref_i_21 = getGlobalNumericValue("ref_i_21");
console.log(`[S11] Read ref_i_21 = ${ref_i_21} from StateManager`);

// S11 - when publishing ref_k_98
console.log(`[S11] Publishing ref_k_98 = ${totals.gain}`);

// S12 - when reading ref_k_98
const ref_k_98 = getGlobalNumericValue("ref_k_98");
console.log(`[S12] Read ref_k_98 = ${ref_k_98} from StateManager`);

// S12 - updateCalculatedDisplayValues
console.log(`[S12] Updating DOM: k_104 = ${valueToDisplay}`);
```

### Step 2: Check StateManager State
In browser console after initialization:
```javascript
// Check what StateManager contains
window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("ref_i_21")  // Should be 50
window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("ref_k_98")  // Should be -1895.40
window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("ref_k_104") // Should be -1895.40
window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("ref_h_21")  // Should be "Capacitance"

// Check S11's internal state
window.Section11?.ReferenceState?.getValue("k_98") // What does S11 think it calculated?

// Check S12's internal state
window.TEUI.SectionModules?.sect12?.ReferenceState?.getValue("k_104") // What did S12 calculate internally?
window.TEUI.SectionModules?.sect12?.ReferenceState?.getValue("h_21") // Is capacitance mode set?
```

### Step 2b: **CRITICAL - Check the k_104 Conditional Logic**
In S12's `calculateEnvelopeTotals()` function, the Excel formula is:
```
K104 = IF(H21="Capacitance", K98, SUM(K101:K102))
```

**Key Investigation**:
1. When does `h_21` get read during Reference calculation?
2. What value does `h_21` have at the moment `k_104` is calculated?
3. Is `k_104` reading `k_98` from the WRONG source (Target instead of Reference)?
4. Look at code around [4012-Section12.js:2109-2123](../sections/4012-Section12.js) - the conditional logic for `k_104`

### Step 3: Trace Initialization Sequence
Look at logs to determine:
1. When does S03 publish `ref_i_21`?
2. When does S11 read `ref_i_21` and calculate `ref_k_98`?
3. When does S12 read `ref_k_98` and display `k_104`?
4. Are they happening in the correct order?

## Hypothesis: The Bug is in k_104 Conditional Logic

Given that:
- ALL other S12 fields work correctly
- Many other fields also read from S11
- ONLY `k_104` shows wrong value
- `k_104` uses a conditional: `IF(h_21="Capacitance", read k_98 from S11, calculate sum)`

**Most Likely Cause**:
The conditional logic for `k_104` is reading `k_98` from the **wrong place**:
- It might be reading from Target state instead of Reference state
- OR it's reading from StateManager at the wrong time
- OR the conditional check for `h_21="Capacitance"` is evaluating incorrectly in Reference mode

**Where to Look**:
Search for `k_104` calculation in S12's `calculateEnvelopeTotals()` function and check:
1. Does it properly distinguish between Reference and Target reads?
2. Does it use `getGlobalNumericValue("ref_k_98")` vs `getNumericValue("k_98")`?
3. Is there a fallback that's using the wrong value?

## Success Criteria

Bug is fixed when:
1. Hard refresh → Initialize → Navigate to S12 → Switch to Reference mode
2. Field `k_104` immediately displays `-1895.40` (correct value)
3. No "priming" required
4. All other S12 fields continue to work correctly (regression test)

**Status**: Open
**Priority**: Medium (works after priming, not blocking)
**Date Created**: 2025-10-21
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21
**Clean Baseline Commit**: `e575b6c` - "📝 docs: Add S12-DEBUG.md - k_104 Reference mode display bug"

USER: Aha! I think I see what is happening, the Cooling Season gains are NOT appearing in the rows 88-93 of the Reference mode for the door/window/skylight objects! They are all 0! After a 'Rest' command at S11 in Reference mode. We need to MODE SWITCH to get those values to correct from 0. When these values in column K read as zeros, the initialized totals produce the value of -4,267.63 ! That is where this value is coming from. So I suspect what may be happening, is S10 is where the door/window/skylight areas are entered by the user (or read from defaults or imports), then S11 needs to rwsd those, update them in the DOM, perform calculations with them, etc. so the issue is probably S10-S11-S12 in that order, and is a failure to properly calculate the K column heatgain values to derive an accurate k_98 value!

Key finding (root cause)
On S11 initialization the code calls calculateAll() before it synchronizes door/window/skylight areas from S10.

Sequence in S11.onSectionRendered():

ModeManager.initialize()
initializeEventHandlers()
ModeManager.refreshUI()
calculateAll() ← runs calculations while S11 still lacks d_88..d_93 area values
isS11Initialized = true
syncAreasFromS10() ← syncs S10 areas INTO S11 and triggers calculateAll() again
Because calculateAll() runs before syncAreasFromS10(), the first Reference calculation (and the first write of ref_k_* values to the StateManager) uses empty/zero area values for rows 88–93, so their K (cooling gains) are zero. That produces the erroneous ref_k_98 (which then propagates and is read by S12). Later when you mode-switch (or otherwise trigger area sync), syncAreasFromS10() runs and recalculates with correct areas, and everything updates — which is why the bug disappears after the "priming" action.

In short: timing/order issue — S11 calculates before it has the S10 area inputs, so ref_k_88..ref_k_93 (and therefore ref_k_98) are written as zeros initially.

Evidence / code pointers
S11.onSectionRendered() calls calculateAll() then syncAreasFromS10() (lines shown in source).
syncAreasFromS10():
has guards (blocks if !isS11Initialized) and only runs after isS11Initialized is set true in onSectionRendered.
reads ref_d_73..ref_d_78 (or d_73..d_78 depending on mode) and writes them to S11 state, then does calculateAll() (so a second calculation does happen).
calculateComponentRow() uses S11 internal state d_88..d_93 for area; if those are still empty/zero, calcHeatgain becomes 0.
S11 publishes ref_k_98 and individual ref_k_<row> values during its Reference engine; the initial publish can contain zeros if the prior calculation used zero areas.
Immediate non-code remedies (safe, for testing or production hot-fix)
You can fix the current page state in the browser console without code changes:

Force S11 to resync areas and recalc:
If you want to explicitly recalc both S11 and S12:
Or trigger a mode toggle which (by design) causes syncAreasFromS10():
These will immediately clear the incorrect zeros and cause ref_k_98 and S12 k_104 to show the correct values.

Recommended safe permanent fix (no risky refactor)
You saw the pattern already; here are two small, low-risk options (I won't change code until you approve):

Option A — reorder S11 initialization (preferred, minimal change)

In S11.onSectionRendered(), call syncAreasFromS10() before the initial calculateAll() so the first calculation has correct areas:
Move the syncAreasFromS10() call up so the order is:
ModeManager.initialize()
injectHeaderControls()
initializeEventHandlers()
ModeManager.refreshUI()
isS11Initialized = true
syncAreasFromS10()
calculateAll()
Rationale: ensures S11 has S10 area inputs before the first calculation and before the first write of ref_k_*.

Option B — delay S11 initial publish of ref_k_* until after syncAreasFromS10() completes

Add a guard so S11 does not write final ref_k_* outputs to StateManager until syncAreasFromS10() has completed at least once (e.g., check that d_88..d_93 are non-empty or a module flag hasSyncedAreasFromS10 is true).
Rationale: more targeted (prevents publishing zeros) but slightly more code paths.
Either option is small and safe; Option A is simpler and fewer conditionals.

Tests to validate the fix (manual)
Hard refresh the page.
Initialize/import.
Without any user interactions, go to S11 and check ref_k_88..ref_k_93 in StateManager (use console: window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue('ref_k_88'), etc.). They should be non-zero for non-zero areas.
Go to S12 Reference mode, verify k_104 equals S11 k_98.
If you want I can implement Option A (move sync call) and run a quick in-repo change + smoke check, but you asked for no new code until you're sure — so I'll wait for your go-ahead.

Next steps (pick one)
I can apply Option A (small code edit), run the minimal test in the browser (and update the repo), and provide the patch.
Or you can run the quick console workaround I gave to unblock immediate testing.
Or I can prepare a tiny unit/integration test (if you want automated confirmation) and the code patch.

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE (Session 2) - THE REAL MYSTERY

**After attempting the S11 sync reorder fix, the mystery deepens:**

### What We Thought Was Wrong
- S11 wasn't syncing door/window areas before calculating
- This caused ref_k_98 to be wrong in StateManager

### What's ACTUALLY Happening (Verified in Latest Logs)
1. **S11 DOM shows CORRECT value** `-1895.40` in Reference mode ✅
2. **S12 DOM shows WRONG value** `-4267.63` in Reference mode ❌  
3. **This happens even AFTER the sync reorder fix**
4. **S11's DOM is correct, but S12 still reads wrong value**

### The Paradox
**S11 displays the correct value `-1895.40` in its DOM, but S12 reads `-4267.63` from somewhere.**

This means one of:
1. **S11 publishes wrong value to StateManager** (even though DOM is correct)
2. **S12 reads from wrong source** (not reading latest StateManager value)
3. **Timing issue**: S12 reads BEFORE S11 publishes the correct value
4. **Multiple S11 publishes**: First publish is wrong, second is correct, but S12 already cached the first

### Next Investigation Required
**Console commands to run after initialization:**
```javascript
// Check what S11 has internally
window.TEUI.SectionModules.sect11.ReferenceState.getValue("k_98")

// Check what S11 published to StateManager  
window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue("ref_k_98")

// Check what S12 has internally
window.TEUI.SectionModules.sect12.ReferenceState.getValue("k_104")

// Check what DOM shows
document.querySelector('[data-field-id="k_98"]').textContent  // S11
document.querySelector('[data-field-id="k_104"]').textContent // S12
```

**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✅
**Attempted Fix**: Reordered S11 initialization (sync before calculate) - **DID NOT FIX**

---

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED (After Diagnostic Testing)

### The Problem
**S11 publishes wrong `ref_k_98 = -4267.63` to StateManager during initialization and it NEVER updates.**

### Why It's Wrong
1. During initialization, `calculateAll()` runs BOTH Target and Reference calculations
2. Reference calculation happens BEFORE `syncAreasFromS10()` has populated door/window/skylight areas
3. Rows 88-93 have zero areas → zero cooling gains in column K
4. Total `ref_k_98` is wrong: `-4267.63` (without cooling gains)
5. This wrong value gets published to StateManager and **never corrects**

### Why Manual Toggle "Works"
- When you manually switch S11 to Reference mode, the DOM reads from S11's **internal ReferenceState**
- S11's internal state is correct (areas eventually synced, calculations ran again)
- But S11 **never re-publishes** the correct value to StateManager
- StateManager still contains the stale wrong value from initialization

### Why S12 Shows Wrong Value
- S12 reads `ref_k_98` from **StateManager** (cross-section communication)
- StateManager has stale `-4267.63` from S11's initial wrong publish
- S12's calculation is correct, but uses wrong input
- Result: `k_104 = -4267.63` instead of correct `-1895.40`

### Why "Priming" Fixes It
- Changing any S12 field triggers `calculateAll()`
- This recalculates S12's Reference model
- At THIS point, S11 has already re-synced areas and re-published correct `ref_k_98`
- S12 now reads correct value from StateManager

### Evidence from Diagnostic Dump
```
PHASE 1: Post-Initialization
  StateManager ref_k_98: -4267.625965209389  ← WRONG, never changes
  S11 ReferenceState k_98: undefined         ← Never populated in console (but works in UI)

ALL PHASES:
  StateManager ref_k_98: -4267.625965209389  ← Stays wrong through all mode toggles
```

### Architectural Issue
This violates **Anti-Pattern 4** from CHEATSHEET.md:
> "Calculation engines correctly compute values and store them in the global StateManager,
> but fail to update the section's internal state objects (TargetState and ReferenceState)."

In S11's case, it's the inverse:
- S11's internal ReferenceState is eventually correct
- But the value published to StateManager during initialization is wrong and never re-published

---

## 🎯 PROPOSED FIX

### Option 1: Ensure syncAreasFromS10() happens BEFORE first calculateAll() (ALREADY ATTEMPTED)
**Status**: Implemented but didn't work - sync still runs in Target mode only

### Option 2: Force syncAreasFromS10() to sync into BOTH states during initialization ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Why**: During initialization, currentMode is "target", so sync only populates TargetState
**Fix**: During initialization, sync should populate both Target AND Reference states

```javascript
function syncAreasFromS10() {
  if (!isS11Initialized) return;
  if (isSyncingFromS10) return;

  isSyncingFromS10 = true;
  try {
    const currentMode = ModeManager.currentMode;

    // ✅ FIX: During initialization, sync into BOTH states
    // This ensures Reference calculations have correct areas
    const isInitialSync = (currentMode === "target" &&
                           ReferenceState.getValue("d_88") === undefined);

    Object.entries(areaSourceMap).forEach(([s11Field, s10Field]) => {
      // Read from appropriate source
      const targetSource = s10Field;
      const refSource = `ref_${s10Field}`;

      const targetValue = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue(targetSource);
      const refValue = window.TEUI.StateManager.getValue(refSource);

      // Write to Target state
      if (targetValue !== null && targetValue !== undefined) {
        TargetState.setValue(s11Field, targetValue);
      }

      // ✅ FIX: Also write to Reference state during initial sync
      if (isInitialSync && refValue !== null && refValue !== undefined) {
        ReferenceState.setValue(s11Field, refValue);
      } else if (currentMode === "reference" && refValue !== null && refValue !== undefined) {
        ReferenceState.setValue(s11Field, refValue);
      }

      // Update DOM
      setCalculatedValue(s11Field,
        currentMode === "target" ? targetValue : refValue,
        "number"
      );
    });

    ModeManager.refreshUI();
    calculateAll();
  } finally {
    isSyncingFromS10 = false;
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Add listener to re-publish ref_k_98 after mode switch
**Why**: Too complex, violates "toggle is display-only" principle
**Status**: Not recommended
