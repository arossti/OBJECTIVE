# Reference Mode Troubleshooting Workplan

**Created:** December 2024  
**Status:** DOM RENDERING TIMING ISSUE - Calculations Working, Display Broken  
**Priority:** HIGH - DOM display timing broken, Reference Mode secondary

## üö® **CRITICAL CORRECTION: DOM Rendering Issue, NOT Calculation Failure** 

### ‚úÖ **Calculations ARE Working Correctly**
**Evidence**: S01 h_10 displays correct TEUI value = 93.6

**This proves**:
- ‚úÖ **Core calculations running** correctly in background
- ‚úÖ **StateManager storing values** correctly  
- ‚úÖ **TEUI calculation logic** not broken
- ‚ùå **DOM display timing** broken for S11 table

### üé® **Real Issue: Display/Rendering Timing Regression**
**The "table full of zeros" is a DOM update timing issue, NOT calculation failure.**

**setTimeout calls were DOM rendering safeguards**, ensuring calculated values got displayed to UI elements in correct sequence. Removing them broke display timing, not calculation timing.

### üìä **Corrected Analysis**
- **Before setTimeout removal**: Calculations run ‚Üí setTimeout delay ‚Üí DOM updates ‚Üí Values display ‚úÖ
- **After setTimeout removal**: Calculations run ‚Üí DOM updates too early ‚Üí Zeros display ‚ùå
- **Background**: Calculations still working (h_10 = 93.6 proves this)

### üîß **Simplified Fix Strategy**
**This is DOM timing, not calculation logic** - much easier to fix!

1. **Restore minimal setTimeout** for DOM update timing, OR
2. **Use Traffic Cop architecture** for proper async DOM update sequencing
3. **No need to fix calculations** - they're working fine

**Much better news than calculation system failure!**

## üö® **CALCULATION REGRESSION DISCOVERED** 

### üîç **Root Cause Identified: setTimeout "Performance Fix" Broke Calculations**
**The setTimeout calls were NOT performance violations - they were calculation sequencing safeguards!**

- ‚ùå **SSv2 after setTimeout removal**: S11 table shows zeros (broken calculations)
- ‚úÖ **STANDARDIZED-STATES**: Working calculations + Reference Mode works on Reset
- ‚úÖ **Original production**: Working calculations (but old architecture)

### üìä **Evidence**
**Sequence of Events:**
1. SSv2 had working calculations with setTimeout calls
2. Removed setTimeout from Sections 01, 09, 10, Dependency.js for "performance violations"  
3. **IMMEDIATELY**: S11 table shows zeros instead of real calculations
4. Performance violations were actually **calculation timing safeguards**

### üéØ **Updated Problem Definition**
**Primary Issue**: Core calculation system broken due to removed setTimeout sequencing
**Secondary Issue**: Reference Mode toggle (investigate after calculations work)

## üìã **New Priority Order**

### 1. **URGENT: Fix S11 Table Calculations (Target Mode)**
**Objective**: Get basic TEUI calculations working again in Application/Target mode

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Temporarily restore setTimeout calls until proper dependency ordering  
- **Option B**: Fix calculation sequencing without setTimeout (proper dependency-based ordering)

### 2. **SECONDARY: Reference Mode Toggle**  
**Objective**: After calculations work, investigate why toggle doesn't trigger same recalculation as Reset button

## üéØ **BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY FROM STANDARDIZED-STATES** 

### üîç **Reset Button Works Perfectly in Reference Mode!**
**Discovered in STANDARDIZED-STATES branch investigation:**

- ‚úÖ **Reference Mode toggle**: Input fields change correctly with red styling
- ‚ùå **Reference Mode toggle**: Calculated results don't update
- ‚úÖ **Reset Button**: BOTH input fields AND calculated results update correctly to Reference values!

### üîë **Root Cause for Reference Mode**
**Reference calculation logic works perfectly** - the issue is Reference Mode toggle doesn't trigger the same recalculation process as Reset button.

### üìä **Evidence from STANDARDIZED-STATES Branch Logs**
```
[StateManager] No imported data found. Performing system refresh...
[StateManager] System refresh completed.
```

**Key Finding**: Reset button calls `systemRefresh()` method that Reference Mode toggle doesn't call.

## üîß **Methodical Fix Strategy**

### Phase 1: Restore Basic Calculations ‚ö° URGENT
**Target**: S11 table shows real values, not zeros

#### Step 1: Identify Broken Calculation Flow
- Map which setTimeout calls were removed
- Identify calculation dependencies that are now broken
- Determine minimum setTimeout restoration needed

#### Step 2: Quick Fix Options
**Option A - Temporary setTimeout Restoration:**
```javascript
// In critical sections, temporarily restore:
setTimeout(() => calculateAll(), 50); // Minimal delay for sequencing
```

**Option B - Proper Dependency Fix:**
- Use existing Traffic Cop architecture for proper calculation ordering
- Leverage StateManager dependency graph for sequencing
- Implement proper async calculation chain

#### Step 3: Verification
- [ ] S11 table shows real calculated values (not zeros)
- [ ] All TEUI calculations work in Application/Target mode
- [ ] Performance acceptable (temporary setTimeout OK for now)

### Phase 2: Reference Mode Toggle Fix
**Target**: Toggle works same as Reset button

#### Step 1: Reset vs Toggle Investigation  
- Find what `systemRefresh()` does that toggle doesn't call
- Map complete Reset button execution flow vs toggle flow
- Identify missing method call in toggle handler

#### Step 2: Implementation
**Expected Fix:**
```javascript
// In ReferenceToggle.js, likely ADD:
window.TEUI.StateManager.systemRefresh(); // Or equivalent method
```

#### Step 3: Verification  
- [ ] Toggle to Reference Mode ‚Üí Calculated values update ‚úÖ
- [ ] Toggle to Application Mode ‚Üí Values revert ‚úÖ  
- [ ] Reset button ‚Üí Still works ‚úÖ
- [ ] S01 comparative analysis ‚Üí Still works ‚úÖ

## üèÅ **Current SSv2 Architecture Benefits to Preserve**

### ‚úÖ **Keep These SSv2 Improvements**
- **Traffic Cop event management system** - Major architectural improvement
- **V2 dual-engine architecture** - Core energy modeling enhancement  
- **Proper recursion protection** - Prevents calculation loops
- **StateManager enhancements** - Better state management
- **Other bug fixes and corrections** - Accumulated improvements

### ‚ö° **Fix These SSv2 Issues**
- **Calculation sequencing** - Broken by setTimeout removal
- **Reference Mode toggle** - Missing systemRefresh() call
- **Performance** - Use proper dependency ordering instead of setTimeout

## üìà **Success Criteria**

### Phase 1 Success (URGENT)
- S11 table displays real calculated values 
- All TEUI calculations work correctly
- Application/Target mode fully functional
- Performance acceptable (setTimeout temporary OK)

### Phase 2 Success  
- Reference Mode toggle works like Reset button
- Both input fields AND calculated results update in Reference Mode
- S01 comparative analysis preserved (e_10 vs h_10)
- No regression in Phase 1 functionality

## üö® **Critical Notes**

1. **setTimeout calls were calculation safeguards, NOT performance issues**
2. **Temporarily restore setTimeout until proper dependency ordering implemented**
3. **SSv2 architectural improvements are valuable - preserve them**
4. **Fix calculations first, Reference Mode second**
5. **Use Traffic Cop architecture for eventual proper dependency ordering**

**Next Action**: Identify which setTimeout removals broke S11 calculations and implement quick fix

## üìã Problem Statement

### Current Issue
Reference Mode UI is **partially working**:
- ‚úÖ **Input fields correctly show Reference values** (f_85 = 5.30 vs 9.35) with red styling
- ‚ùå **Calculated results still display Application values** (i_85 = 16,666.50) instead of Reference calculations (expected 29,402.23)

### Evidence from System Logs
- StateManager is working correctly: Loading "OBC SB10 5.5-6 Z6" with 127 reference values
- Reference data loading is successful - no errors in this process
- The issue is **post-calculation display**, not data loading

### What Was Working Previously
- Reference Mode functionality WAS working but regressed during refactoring
- User confirmed: "This functionality WAS working but regressed during subsequent refactors"

## üö´ What We've Tried (And Failed)

### 1. Section calculateAll() Fixes
- **Modified**: Sections 09, 10, 11, 12 to respect Reference Mode
- **Approach**: Check `isReferenceMode()` and only run appropriate engine
- **Result**: Input fields work, calculated results don't

### 2. setTimeout Performance Fix  
- **Modified**: Section 10 slider handler
- **Approach**: Removed `setTimeout(calculateAll, 100)` 
- **Result**: Performance violation addressed, but main issue persists

### 3. Previous setDualEngineValue Attempts (Reverted)
- **Multiple approaches**: Various dual-state storage mechanisms
- **Result**: All reverted due to being incorrect/incomplete

## üéØ How It SHOULD Work

### Expected Reference Mode Behavior
1. **Toggle Reference Mode ON**:
   - Input fields change to Reference values with red styling ‚úÖ (Working)
   - Calculated results change to Reference calculations ‚ùå (Broken)
   - Example: f_85 changes from 9.35 ‚Üí 5.30, i_85 changes from 16,666.50 ‚Üí 29,402.23

2. **S01 Comparative Analysis** (Always available):
   - e_10 shows Reference calculations ‚úÖ (Working based on logs)
   - h_10 shows Application calculations ‚úÖ (Working)
   - This should work regardless of current UI mode

3. **Toggle Reference Mode OFF**:
   - All values revert to Application calculations and styling

### Technical Flow Specification
```
Reference Mode Toggle ‚Üí 
  ReferenceToggle.js detects mode change ‚Üí
  Calculator.calculateAll() ‚Üí
  Section calculateAll() checks isReferenceMode() ‚Üí
  IF Reference Mode: Only run calculateReferenceModel() ‚Üí
  Reference values display in UI
```

## üîß Methodical Troubleshooting Plan

### Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis (Investigation Only)

#### Step 1: Baseline Confirmation ‚úÖ
- **Action**: Revert to touchstone commit ba275e8
- **Purpose**: Clean foundation with working TEUI calculations
- **Status**: COMPLETED

#### Step 2: Diagnostic Investigation (NO CODE CHANGES)
**Objective**: Understand WHY before implementing HOW

**Target Questions**:
1. **Are Reference calculations running?** 
   - Add diagnostic logging to `calculateReferenceModel()` execution
   - Verify Reference engine is called in Reference Mode

2. **Are Reference values being stored?** 
   - Check if `ref_i_85` exists in StateManager after Reference calculations
   - Verify dual-state storage mechanism

3. **Is setDualEngineValue working correctly?** 
   - Log what values it stores and where
   - Verify mode detection within storage logic

4. **Is Reference Mode detection working?** 
   - Verify `isReferenceMode()` returns correct boolean
   - Check timing of mode detection calls

5. **Are DOM elements being updated?** 
   - Check if DOM gets Reference values at all
   - Verify formatting and display pipeline

**Diagnostic Methodology**:
- Add temporary console.log statements (not permanent code)
- Check StateManager state in browser console manually
- Inspect DOM elements in Reference Mode using DevTools
- Compare Application vs Reference Mode step-by-step
- Document exact breakpoint in the data flow

#### Step 3: Flow Break Point Identification
Document where the flow breaks:
- [ ] Reference calculations run 
- [ ] Reference values stored with ref_ prefix  
- [ ] setDualEngineValue chooses correct storage
- [ ] DOM elements receive Reference values
- [ ] Display formatting applied correctly

### Phase 2: Targeted Fix (After Root Cause Identified)

Based on Phase 1 findings, implement **ONE** targeted fix:
- **If storage issue** ‚Üí Fix setDualEngineValue logic
- **If display issue** ‚Üí Fix DOM update logic  
- **If calculation issue** ‚Üí Fix Reference calculation flow
- **If mode detection issue** ‚Üí Fix isReferenceMode detection

**Implementation Rules**:
1. Make ONE change at a time
2. Test thoroughly after each change
3. Document the specific fix and rationale
4. Verify both Reference Mode AND S01 comparative analysis

## üèÅ Performance Violations Investigation

### Current Status
- **Chrome**: setTimeout violations present (`[Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took <N>ms`)
- **Safari**: No violations reported  

### Investigation Plan
1. **Audit remaining setTimeout calls** using grep results
2. **Identify problematic setTimeout patterns**:
   - Calculation sequencing delays
   - UI update delays that cause reflow
3. **Fix only performance-critical violations**
4. **Maintain calculation correctness**

### Known setTimeout Locations (From Previous Audit)
- Section 10: Slider handlers (FIXED)
- Section 01: Calculation sequencing 
- SectionIntegrator: Volume metrics updates
- StateManager: Reference data loading
- Multiple other locations requiring analysis

## üìà Success Criteria

### Primary Goal
- Reference Mode displays Reference calculated values correctly
- Application Mode displays Application calculated values correctly
- S01 comparative analysis always available (e_10 vs h_10)

### Secondary Goals  
- Performance violations eliminated or minimized
- No regression in existing TEUI calculation functionality
- Clean, maintainable code architecture

## üìù Documentation Requirements

### Investigation Phase
- Document each diagnostic finding
- Record exact breakpoint location
- Note any unexpected behavior patterns

### Implementation Phase
- Document the specific fix implemented
- Explain why this fix addresses the root cause
- Record test cases that verify the fix

### Completion Phase
- Update this workplan with resolution details
- Create regression test procedures
- Establish new touchstone commit if needed
