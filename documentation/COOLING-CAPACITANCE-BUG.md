### Surgical Repair Attempt 2 (Oct 18, 2025)

**Observation:**
The previous fix was partially successful. 
- S11 now correctly responds to changes in the `h_21` capacitance dropdown (`Static`/`Dynamic`) when in Reference mode.
- However, S11 does **not** respond to changes from the `i_21` capacitance factor slider when in Reference mode. The slider works correctly in Target mode.

**Diagnosis:**
This indicates the issue is not with the listener in S11 (as it correctly receives `ref_h_21`), but with the publisher in S03. The event handler for the `i_21` slider in `4012-Section03.js` is still not correctly publishing the `ref_i_21` value to the `StateManager` when in reference mode. The `ModeManager.setValue` call is likely being made with the wrong context or is missing entirely for the slider's 'input' or 'change' event in reference mode.

**Plan:**
1.  Re-examine the event listeners for the `i_21` slider within `4012-Section03.js`.
2.  Ensure the 'input' and 'change' event handlers for the slider correctly use `ModeManager.setValue` to publish the `ref_i_21` value when the section is in reference mode.
3.  This will create parity with the working Target mode implementation and the now-working `h_21` dropdown.
