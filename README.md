## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

ARTexplorer (Algebraic Rational Trigonometry Explorer) is a standalone web application for exploring polyhedral geometry using Rational Trigonometry principles. Built with Three.js and pure JavaScript, it visualizes nested polyhedra in both 3D Cartesian (XYZ) and 4D tetrahedral (WXYZ/Quadray) coordinate spaces.

The application combines two profound geometric frameworks:

- **R. Buckminster Fuller's Synergetics** - Tetrahedral geometry and spatial relationships
- **N.J. Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry** - Pure algebraic geometry (quadrance/spread)

### 1.2 Project Philosophy

ARTexplorer implements a **RATIONAL approach to computational geometry** using N.J. Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry (RT) framework. While Three.js requires floating-point coordinates for rendering, all geometry _generation_ uses pure algebraic methods:

#### Core RT Principles

1. **Quadrance (Q) instead of Distance (d)**
   - Classical: `d = √(Δx² + Δy² + Δz²)` (requires irrational √)
   - RT-Pure: `Q = Δx² + Δy² + Δz²` (pure algebra, deferred √)

2. **Spread (s) instead of Angle (θ)**
   - Classical: `θ = arccos(v₁·v₂ / |v₁||v₂|)` (transcendental functions)
   - RT-Pure: `s = 1 - (v₁·v₂)² / (Q₁·Q₂)` (pure algebra)

3. **Deferred √ Expansion**
   - Compute all relationships in quadrance space
   - Only take √ at final THREE.Vector3 creation
   - Preserves algebraic exactness throughout generation pipeline

4. **Symbolic Algebra for Radicals (PurePhi Method)**
   - **Philosophy:** Represent radicals in exact form `(a + b√n)/c` until GPU boundary
   - **Golden Ratio (φ):** Work symbolically as `(a + b√5)/c` for 15-decimal precision
     - φ = (1 + √5)/2 → symbolic constant
     - φ² = (3 + √5)/2 using identity φ² = φ + 1 (not multiplication!)
     - 1/φ = (-1 + √5)/2 using identity 1/φ = φ - 1 (not division!)
   - **Achievements:** Identity error = 0e+0, quadrance error = 2.17e-19 (460× improvement)
   - **Extension principle:** Apply to √2, √3, √6 wherever premature expansion loses precision

### 1.3 Why This Matters

Three.js (and all GPU rendering) ultimately uses floating-point. Our RT approach provides advantages in both **geometry generation** and **rendering performance**:

**Computational Advantages:**

- Fewer numerical errors accumulate during construction
- Algebraic relationships are preserved until final output
- Educational value: demonstrates geometry without transcendental functions
- Philosophical alignment: proves most "trigonometry" is unnecessary

**Rendering Optimizations:**

- **Proper Face Winding**: Counter-clockwise vertex ordering ensures correct outward-facing normals, enabling efficient backface culling for 2× rendering speedup
- **Polygon Reduction**: RT geodesic subdivision produces superior triangle distribution compared to THREE.js UV spheres:
  - Geodesic Icosahedron (freq-3): ~180 triangles vs THREE.SphereGeometry (16×16): 512 triangles
  - 65% fewer polygons for equivalent visual quality
  - Lower GPU memory usage and faster rendering
- **Geometric Efficiency**: Geodesic distribution provides more uniform sphere approximation than latitude-longitude UV mapping

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Rational Trigonometry

**Rational Trigonometry** (developed by N.J. Wildberger) replaces classical trigonometry's reliance on transcendental functions (sin, cos, tan) with purely algebraic operations:

- **Quadrance**: Q = a² (replaces distance `d`)
- **Spread**: s = sin²θ (replaces angle `θ`)
- Maintains algebraic exactness throughout calculations
- Only expands to decimals at GPU boundary

This approach eliminates computational errors from floating-point transcendental function approximations and enables exact symbolic computation.

### 2.2 Coordinate Systems

ARTexplorer supports two complementary coordinate systems:

#### Cartesian XYZ (Traditional 3D)

- Three orthogonal axes at 90° angles
- Familiar x, y, z coordinates
- Standard in computer graphics

#### Quadray WXYZ (Tetrahedral 4D)

- Four equiangular axes from tetrahedron center to vertices
- Natural for describing tetrahedral and icosahedral symmetries
- Fuller's "Isotropic Vector Matrix" (IVM) foundation
- Conversion methods in `rt-math.js`

### 2.3 PurePhi Symbolic Algebra

High-precision golden ratio calculations using symbolic representation:

- φ = (1 + √5)/2
- Symbolic forms like `{a: 1, b: 1}` represent (a + b√5)/2
- Used for icosahedra, dodecahedra, and φ-dependent polyhedra
- Achieves machine-precision accuracy (< 1e-15 error)
- Methods implemented in `rt-polyhedra.js`

## 6. Mathematical Background

### 6.1 On Dimensions and Coordinate Systems

Cartesian 3D space requires **3 orthogonal axes** but Fuller's tetrahedral space requires **4 equiangular axes**. This doesn't make space "4D" in the physics sense (you still have 3 degrees of freedom for position), but it does mean that natural spatial coordinatization is fundamentally 4-fold, not 3-fold.

The common assertion that "time is the 4th dimension" conflates three separate concepts:

1. The **geometric fact** that Cartesian space uses 3 axes (an arbitrary choice)
2. With the **assumption** that spatial dimensions must therefore = 3 (demonstrably false)
3. Leading to the **conclusion** that any 4th dimension must be non-spatial (misleading)

In physics, "dimension" means **degrees of freedom** - independent ways a system can vary. In geometry, "dimension" refers to **coordinate axes** needed to naturally describe space. Fuller was correct: **spatial geometry is inherently 4-fold** (tetrahedral), and Cartesian reduction to 3 axes is a convenient but limiting convention that obscures the natural symmetry of space.

### 6.2 Rational Trigonometry Principles

Rational Trigonometry eliminates transcendental functions by working directly with squared quantities:

**Classical vs RT Comparison:**

| Concept          | Classical        | RT-Pure        | Advantage    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Distance         | d = √(Δx² + Δy²) | Q = Δx² + Δy²  | No √ needed  |
| Angle            | θ = arccos(...)  | s = 1 - (...)² | Pure algebra |
| Perpendicularity | v₁·v₂ = 0        | v₁·v₂ = 0      | Same!        |
| Pythagorean      | a² + b² = c²     | Q₁ + Q₂ = Q₃   | Same!        |

**Key Insight:** Most geometric relationships work naturally with squared quantities. Taking square roots is often an unnecessary step that introduces computational error.

### 6.4 Platonic Solid Face Spreads (Wildberger Chapter 26)

N.J. Wildberger's "Divine Proportions" (Chapter 26) derives the **face spread** S for each Platonic solid - the spread between adjacent faces meeting at an edge. Remarkably, all five face spreads are **rational numbers**:

| Solid | Face Spread S | Derivation |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Tetrahedron** | S = 8/9 | Isosceles triangle CMD with quadrances 3Q/4, 3Q/4, Q |
| **Cube** | S = 1 | Adjacent faces perpendicular (trivial case) |
| **Octahedron** | S = 8/9 | Same as tetrahedron (see relationship below) |
| **Icosahedron** | S = 4/9 | Uses pentagon α = (5-√5)/8, β = (5+√5)/8 |
| **Dodecahedron** | S = 4/5 | Derived from (4α - 1)/(4α²) where α = (5-√5)/8 |

**The Tetrahedron-Octahedron Relationship:**

Wildberger establishes a profound geometric fact: the six midpoints of a tetrahedron's edges form a regular octahedron. This can also be seen by slicing off the four corner tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedron - the remaining central solid is an octahedron that shares faces with those corner tetrahedra. Since adjacent faces of the corner tetrahedra become adjacent faces of the central octahedron, **both solids must have the same face spread: S = 8/9**.

This relationship has significant implications for IVM (Isotropic Vector Matrix) and Cuboctahedron/Vector Equilibrium implementations:

- **Space-filling property**: Tetrahedra and octahedra together fill space completely (the octet truss)
- **Shared face spread**: The 8/9 face spread creates consistent dihedral angles at all tet-oct interfaces
- **Midpoint construction**: An octahedron can be generated directly from tetrahedron edge midpoints
- **Dual construction**: The cuboctahedron (Vector Equilibrium) vertices lie at tetrahedron edge midpoints

**Implementation Note:** While ARTexplorer constructs tetrahedra and octahedra independently (for clarity and flexibility), the shared face spread S = 8/9 could enable more efficient IVM matrix generation by deriving octahedra from tetrahedron midpoints, ensuring perfect geometric alignment at all interfaces.

**Additional Quadrance Relationships (Wildberger Exercises 26.1-26.2):**

For a tetrahedron with edge quadrance Q:
- Q(vertex → opposite face centroid) = 2Q/3
- Q(vertex → tetrahedron center) = 3Q/8
- The face spread S = 8/9 equals s(PA, PB) where P is the tetrahedron center

**Pentagon Constants (Exercise 14.3, p.166):**

The icosahedron and dodecahedron calculations use two key constants:
- α = (5 - √5)/8 ≈ 0.345 (base spread at pentagon vertices)
- β = (5 + √5)/8 ≈ 0.905 (star spread / apex angle)

These satisfy the elegant relationships:
- α + β = 5/4
- α · β = 5/16
- β/α = φ² (golden ratio squared!)

ARTexplorer implements these as `RT.PurePhi.pentagon.alpha()` and `RT.PurePhi.pentagon.beta()` with cached √5 expansion for maximum precision.

### 6.5 RT Implementation Summary: Wildberger Compliance

This section documents how ARTexplorer implements Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry principles from "Divine Proportions: Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry."

#### Core RT Functions (`rt-math.js`)

| Wildberger Concept | ARTexplorer Implementation | Location |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------- |
| **Quadrance** Q = Δx² + Δy² + Δz² | `RT.quadrance(p1, p2)` | rt-math.js:36-41 |
| **Spread** s = 1 - (v₁·v₂)²/(Q₁·Q₂) | `RT.spread(v1, v2)` | rt-math.js:62-67 |
| **Spread ↔ Degrees** | `RT.spreadToDegrees(s)`, `RT.degreesToSpread(θ)` | rt-math.js:728-744 |
| **Euler Formula** V - E + F = 2 | `RT.verifyEuler(V, E, F)` | rt-math.js:215-217 |
| **Edge Validation** | `RT.validateEdges(vertices, edges, expectedQ)` | rt-math.js:709-720 |

#### Golden Ratio Symbolic Algebra (`RT.PurePhi`)

Wildberger emphasizes working with algebraic identities to avoid premature √ expansion. ARTexplorer implements this via symbolic algebra:

| Identity | Implementation | Benefit |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| φ = (1 + √5)/2 | `RT.PurePhi.Symbolic(1, 1, 2)` | Single √5 expansion |
| φ² = φ + 1 | `RT.PurePhi.constants.phiSq` | Exact (not φ × φ!) |
| 1/φ = φ - 1 | `RT.PurePhi.constants.invPhi` | No division needed |
| φ³ = 2φ + 1 | `RT.PurePhi.cubed()` | Derived from identity |
| φ⁴ = 3φ + 2 | `RT.PurePhi.fourthPower()` | Derived from identity |

The `Symbolic` class maintains exact `(a + b√5)/c` form with operations:
- `multiply(other)` - Preserves algebraic form
- `add(other)`, `subtract(other)` - Common denominator arithmetic
- `scale(n)`, `divide(n)` - Scalar operations
- `toDecimal()` - GPU boundary expansion (called once, at end)

#### Spread Polynomials (Chapter 14)

For regular n-gon diagonal quadrances, Wildberger defines Sₖ(s) polynomials:

| Polynomial | Formula | ARTexplorer |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| S₁(s) | s | `RT.SpreadPolynomials.S1(s)` |
| S₂(s) | 4s(1-s) | `RT.SpreadPolynomials.S2(s)` |
| S₃(s) | s(3-4s)² | `RT.SpreadPolynomials.S3(s)` |
| S₅(s) | s(5-20s+16s²)² | `RT.SpreadPolynomials.S5(s)` |
| Sₙ(s) | Chebyshev recurrence | `RT.SpreadPolynomials.Sn(n, s)` |

#### Star Spreads for Regular Polygons (Theorem 98)

Edge quadrance formula: **Q_edge = 4 · s · Q_circumradius**

| n-gon | Star Spread s | ARTexplorer | RT-Pure? |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Triangle (3) | 3/4 | `RT.StarSpreads.triangle()` | Yes (exact rational) |
| Square (4) | 1/2 | `RT.StarSpreads.square()` | Yes (exact rational) |
| Pentagon (5) | (5+√5)/8 = β | `RT.StarSpreads.pentagon()` | Yes (cached √5) |
| Hexagon (6) | 1/4 | `RT.StarSpreads.hexagon()` | Yes (exact rational) |
| Octagon (8) | (2-√2)/4 | `RT.StarSpreads.octagon()` | Yes (cached √2) |
| Decagon (10) | (3-√5)/8 = α | `RT.StarSpreads.decagon()` | Yes (cached √5) |
| Dodecagon (12) | (2-√3)/4 | `RT.StarSpreads.dodecagon()` | Yes (cached √3) |

#### Polyhedra Construction (`rt-polyhedra.js`)

| Solid | Construction Method | RT Validation |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Tetrahedron** | Alternating cube vertices | Q = 8s² verified |
| **Cube** | (±s, ±s, ±s) | Q = 4s² verified |
| **Octahedron** | Face centers of cube | Q = 2s² verified |
| **Icosahedron** | 3 orthogonal golden rectangles | PurePhi symbolic algebra |
| **Dodecahedron** | 8 cube + 12 φ-permutation vertices | 1/φ = φ-1 identity |

#### Deferred √ Expansion Pattern

ARTexplorer follows Wildberger's principle of deferring irrational expansion:

```
1. ALGEBRAIC SPACE: Work with quadrance Q, spread s, symbolic (a+b√n)/c
2. RELATIONSHIPS: Use RT identities (Pythagorean, spread law, cross law)
3. GPU BOUNDARY: Only call Math.sqrt() when creating THREE.Vector3
```

This pattern is consistently applied in:
- `RT.spherePlaneCircleRadius()` - Computes circleRadiusQ, single √ at end
- `RT.PurePhi.Symbolic.toDecimal()` - Expands √5 once
- `RT.PureRadicals.QUADRAY_GRID_INTERVAL` - √6/4 computed once, cached
- All polygon generators - Cached radical values from `RT.PureRadicals`

#### Gauss-Wantzel Constructibility

ARTexplorer respects the Gauss-Wantzel theorem for polygon constructibility:

**RT-Pure (algebraic radicals only):** n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12
**Classical fallback (transcendental):** n = 7, 9, 11, 13, ...

The heptagon (n=7) requires solving an irreducible cubic - no √-expression exists. ARTexplorer correctly falls back to `Math.sin/cos` for these cases while logging a warning.

### 6.3 Tetrahedral Geometry

The regular tetrahedron is the fundamental unit of 3D space (Fuller's "quantum of space"):

- **4 vertices** arranged symmetrically
- **6 edges** of equal length
- **4 faces** (equilateral triangles)
- **Dihedral angle**: arccos(1/3) ≈ 70.53° (exact in RT: spread = 8/9)

**Quadray Coordinate System:**

- Origin at tetrahedron center
- Four basis vectors to vertices
- Natural for tetrahedral/icosahedral symmetry
- All coordinates positive (no negative numbers needed)
