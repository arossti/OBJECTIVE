# TEUI LOGS - Debugging Session Log File

**Purpose**: Share verbose/recursive logging output for AI analysis without triggering new Cursor conversation threads.

**Instructions**: 
1. Copy-paste relevant logs below the "CURRENT LOGS" section
2. Include context (branch, action taken, expected vs actual behavior)
3. Clear/replace previous logs each session to keep file focused

## PREVIOUS SESSION ARCHIVE
[Keep brief notes from previous sessions for context]

**Last Session Summary**: DOM rendering timing issue identified - calculations working (h_10=93.6) but S11 table showing zeros due to setTimeout removal affecting display timing, not calculation logic.
