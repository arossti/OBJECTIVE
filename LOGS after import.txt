# TEUI LOGS - Debugging Session Log File

**Purpose**: Share verbose/recursive logging output for AI analysis without triggering new Cursor conversation threads.

**Instructions**: 
1. Copy-paste relevant logs below the "CURRENT LOGS" section
2. Include context (branch, action taken, expected vs actual behavior)
3. Clear/replace previous logs each session to keep file focused

## S11 DOM TIMING DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

**Added diagnostic logging to Section 11 to investigate DOM timing regression:**

### Browser Console Commands:
```javascript
// 1. Check current S11 table state anytime:
window.TEUI.SectionModules.sect11.diagnoseDOMState()

// 2. Trigger manual calculation and see timing logs:
window.TEUI.SectionModules.sect11.calculateAll()

// 3. Check if h_10 TEUI value is working (proves calculations work):
document.querySelector('[data-field-id="h_10"]')?.textContent
```

### What to Test:
1. **Load SSv2 page** → Check console for S11 timing logs during initialization
2. **Run `diagnoseDOMState()`** → See if DOM shows zeros but State has real values
3. **Change any S11 input** → Watch timing logs to see if DOM updates immediately
4. **Compare with setTimeout timing** → Test if adding setTimeout fixes the issue

### Expected Log Pattern (Working):
```
[S11 TIMING] calculateAll() STARTED
[S11 TIMING] Running Reference Model...
[S11 DOM] setDualEngineValue(i_85, 16666.5) STARTED
[S11 DOM] i_85 - DOM UPDATED: "0.00" → "16,666.50"
[S11 TIMING] Application Model COMPLETE
```

### Problem Pattern (Broken):
```
[S11 TIMING] calculateAll() STARTED
[S11 DOM] i_85 - DOM ELEMENT NOT FOUND! Update failed.
OR
[S11 DOM] i_85 - DOM UPDATED: "0.00" → "0.00" (value not changing)
```

## CURRENT LOGS

**Session**: [DATE/TIME]
**Branch**: SSv2
**Context**: Testing S11 DOM timing issue - calculations work (h_10=93.6) but S11 table shows zeros
**Issue**: DOM rendering timing regression after setTimeout removal

**Expected Behavior**: S11 table shows real calculated values (16,666.50, etc.)
**Actual Behavior**: S11 table shows zeros across all calculated fields

### Log Output:
```
[Paste verbose logs here - console output, browser dev tools, etc.]
```

## PREVIOUS SESSION ARCHIVE
[Keep brief notes from previous sessions for context]

**Last Session Summary**: DOM rendering timing issue identified - calculations working (h_10=93.6) but S11 table showing zeros due to setTimeout removal affecting display timing, not calculation logic.
