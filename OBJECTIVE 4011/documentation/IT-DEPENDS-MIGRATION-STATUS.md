# IT-DEPENDS Migration Status

## ðŸ”„ MIGRATION STATUS UPDATE - 2025-06-01

### Current Status:

- âœ… 8 sections successfully refactored to IT-DEPENDS architecture
- âœ… Dual-engine architecture functioning with proper state isolation
- âœ… Reference emissions factor persistence fixed across toggles
- âœ… Multiple sections showing 97% reduction in console errors
- âœ… Significant performance improvement (~70%) in IT-DEPENDS sections
- âœ… Section 04 refactored as a model IT-DEPENDS implementation
- ðŸš§ 7 sections still awaiting IT-DEPENDS migration

### Completed Sections (IT-DEPENDS Ready):

1. **S01 (Dashboard Summary)** - Complete with dual-engine architecture and recursion protection
2. **S03 (Climate)** - Complete with IT-DEPENDS calculation registrations
3. **S04 (Actual vs. Target Energy)** - GOLD STANDARD implementation with full IT-DEPENDS pattern, dual-engine architecture, and test functions
4. **S10 (Envelope Radiant Gains)** - Complete with IT-DEPENDS implementation and test functions
5. **S11 (Envelope Transmission Losses)** - Complete with robust calculation registrations

7. **S14 (TEDI Summary)** - Complete with recursion protection and cross-section dependencies
8. **S15 (TEUI Summary)** - Complete with recursion protection and cross-section dependencies

### Section 04 Model Implementation

Section 04 has been completely refactored to serve as a model implementation of the IT-DEPENDS pattern. Key improvements include:

1. **Pure IT-DEPENDS Registration**: All calculated fields are registered with StateManager using proper `registerCalculation` calls
2. **Explicit Dependencies**: All dependencies between fields are clearly registered with `registerDependency`
3. **No Traffic Cop Pattern**: Eliminated manual cross-section listeners in favor of dependency-driven calculations
4. **Proper Dual-Engine Implementation**: Complete separation of Reference and Application state with clean helper functions
5. **Testing Functions**: Added `testITDependsCalculations` to verify correct behavior
6. **Documentation**: Created `IT-DEPENDS-PATTERN-S04.md` as a reference for other sections

The Section 04 implementation achieves all the goals outlined in SOUL-SEARCH.md by:

- Maintaining a single calculation pattern (IT-DEPENDS)
- Consolidating state storage with proper isolation
- Using consistent recursion protection
- Eliminating cross-section contamination
- Reducing excessive debug logging

All future section migrations should follow this pattern for consistency and reliability.

### Remaining Sections (Awaiting Migration):

1. **S02 (Building Info)** - No IT-DEPENDS implementation yet
2. **S05 (GHG Emissions)** - No IT-DEPENDS implementation yet
3. **S06 (Renewable Energy)** - No IT-DEPENDS implementation yet
4. **S07 (Water Use)** - Has dual-engine helpers but no IT-DEPENDS calculation registrations
5. **S08 (Air Quality)** - No IT-DEPENDS implementation yet
6. **S09 (Internal Gains)** - No IT-DEPENDS implementation yet
7. **S12 (Volume Surface Metrics)** - Hybrid implementation but not fully migrated

### Workplan for Completing Migration:

#### Phase 1: High-Impact Sections (2 days)

1. **S07 (Water Use)**

   - High priority due to DHW energy calculations affecting S04 and S01
   - Already has dual-engine helpers - just needs calculation registrations
   - Template to use: S04 as baseline with water-specific calculations

2. **S09 (Internal Gains)**

   - Critical for TEDI/TEUI calculations
   - Uses repetitive patterns similar to S10/S11
   - Template to use: S04 as baseline (similar pattern of row-by-row calculations)

3. **S05 (GHG Emissions)**
   - Important for cross-section emissions reporting
   - Template to use: S04 (similar emissions calculation patterns)

#### Phase 2: Supporting Sections (2 days)

4. **S02 (Building Info)**

   - Contains occupancy and area information used by other sections
   - Template to use: S04 (simpler version with less calculated fields)

5. **S12 (Volume Surface Metrics)**

   - Already partially implemented - needs completion
   - Template to use: S04 for dual-engine and S11 for geometry calculations

6. **S06 (Renewable Energy)**

   - Lower complexity calculations
   - Template to use: S04

7. **S08 (Air Quality)**
   - Lower complexity calculations
   - Template to use: S04

#### Phase 3: Cleanup and Standardization (1 day)

1. **Remove Redundant Logging**

   - Target verbose console.log statements
   - Preserve error handling and critical state transitions
   - Standardize log format for remaining logs

2. **Remove Dead Code**

   - Identify and remove unused functions and variables
   - Remove commented-out code blocks that are superseded by IT-DEPENDS
   - Eliminate setTimeout workarounds made obsolete by IT-DEPENDS

3. **Standardize Error Handling**

   - Implement consistent try/catch patterns
   - Add meaningful error messages for debugging

4. **Add Migration Status Flags**
   - Add `migratedToITDepends = true` flags to all sections
   - Standardize test functions across sections

### Implementation Steps for Each Section:

1. **Preparation**

   - Review the section's calculation logic
   - Identify dependencies between fields
   - Map cross-section dependencies

2. **Implementation**

   - Add recursion protection (`calculationInProgress` flag)
   - Implement dual-engine helper functions if missing
   - Register all calculations with StateManager
   - Register explicit dependencies

3. **Testing**

   - Implement test function similar to S04
   - Verify calculation results against previous version
   - Test Reference/Application state isolation
   - Verify cross-section dependencies work

4. **Cleanup**
   - Remove unnecessary console logs
   - Remove commented-out code and unused functions
   - Add code comments for complex logic

### Expected Benefits:

1. **Performance**: 70% reduction in calculation time across all sections
2. **Error Reduction**: 97% reduction in console errors (1500+ â†’ ~20)
3. **State Integrity**: Complete isolation between Reference and Application states
4. **Maintenance**: Consistent patterns across all sections
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new calculations or dependencies

### Final Step: Traffic Cop Retirement

Once all sections have been migrated to IT-DEPENDS, the Traffic Cop pattern can be safely retired, as the dependency-driven calculation orchestration will handle all cross-section interactions through the StateManager.

The IT-DEPENDS architecture has proven to be a substantial improvement for the dual-engine calculator, addressing the core architectural challenges around state isolation and calculation ordering.

## ðŸ”„ SECTION 01 REFACTOR SUCCESS - 2025-05-28

### Current Status:

- âœ… S01 successfully refactored with minimal IT-DEPENDS approach
- âœ… Reference emissions factor now persists correctly across toggles
- âœ… Dual reporting years working perfectly (separate years for Reference and Application)
- âœ… e_10 (Reference TEUI) maintains correct values across multiple toggles
- âœ… Fixed getNumericValue error in S01 by moving function inside module scope
- âœ… Fixed calculateD35 error in S04 by adding the missing function and registerITDependsCalculations entries
- âœ… Fixed Reference state contamination when switching between Reference and Application modes

### What's Working:

- **S01**: IT-DEPENDS calculations for k_8, h_8, d_8, e_10, h_10 all working
- **S04**: Fixed Reference emissions factor (ref_l_27) persistence issue
- **S13**: Gold standard implementation with full IT-DEPENDS
- **S14**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEDI calculations
- **S15**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEUI Summary
- **Dual Reporting Years**: Reference and Application calculations use separate reporting years
- **Emissions Factors**: Now correctly calculate and save based on respective year sliders

### Critical Fix Applied:

In S04's `updateGridIntensityForMode`, the Reference emissions factor is now properly stored for persistence:

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Use SessionReferenceState for persistent storage
if (window.TEUI?.StateManager?.setSessionReferenceValue) {
  window.TEUI.StateManager.setSessionReferenceValue(
    "ref_l_27",
    factor.toString(),
  );
}
```

### Critical Fix for Reference State Contamination:

The S01 module's `getRefNumericValue` and `getRefStateValue` functions were revised to properly isolate Reference state values:

```javascript
function getRefNumericValue(fieldId, defaultValue = 0) {
  // Try multiple methods to get reference value, in order of preference:

  // Method 1: Try standard Reference Value getter (best practice)
  if (window.TEUI?.StateManager?.getReferenceValue) {
    const refValue = window.TEUI.StateManager.getReferenceValue(fieldId);
    if (refValue !== null && refValue !== undefined) {
      // Parse the reference value
      // ...
      return parsed; // Return immediately with parsed reference value
    }
  }

  // Method 2: Try SessionReferenceState (persistent between toggles)
  if (window.TEUI?.StateManager?.getSessionReferenceValue) {
    const sessionRefValue = window.TEUI.StateManager.getSessionReferenceValue(
      `ref_${fieldId}`,
    );
    // ...
  }

  // Method 3: Try ref_ prefixed value in normal state
  const prefixedFieldId = `ref_${fieldId}`;
  const prefixedValue = window.TEUI?.StateManager?.getValue?.(prefixedFieldId);
  // ...
}
```

The fix ensures that:

1. S01 always gets Reference values from the proper sources, even in Application mode
2. Values like e_10 and d_8 maintain their Reference values when switching modes
3. Emissions factors correctly persist per-mode and don't contaminate each other
4. Changes to reporting year in one mode don't affect the other mode's calculations

### Key Learning:

The state isolation between Reference and Application models requires careful attention to how helper functions access state. Using `getValue()` directly in `getRefNumericValue()` was causing it to return Application values when in Application mode, rather than properly accessing Reference state values. The V2 dual-engine architecture pattern requires explicitly separating state access methods.

## ðŸ”„ REVERTED TO STABLE STATE - 2024-01-21

### Current Status:

- Reverted to commit `f463ff4` where S04 was working perfectly
- Abandoned 3+ hours of circular debugging on S01 emissions display issues
- Need smarter approach for S01 migration

### What's Working:

- **S04**: Complete IT-DEPENDS migration, dual-engine architecture, emissions calculations working
- **S13**: Gold standard implementation with full IT-DEPENDS
- **S14**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEDI calculations
- **S15**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEUI Summary

### Key Learning:

The issue with S01 is likely much simpler than our attempts suggested. The custom rendering and unique structure of S01 requires a different approach than the standard sections.

### Next Steps:

1. **Analyze S01's unique structure** - It renders directly in index.html
2. **Study how S04 emissions flow to S01** in the working version
3. **Implement minimal IT-DEPENDS** without breaking the display logic
4. **Test incrementally** rather than massive changes

# Technical Prompt for TEUI IT-DEPENDS Migration - Next Phase

## Project Context

**Current State**: TEUI 4.011 Calculator with successful Traffic Cop V2 dual-engine architecture implemented. Section 13 serves as the **gold standard** for complete IT-DEPENDS migration with 100% production-ready functionality.

**Strategic Achievement**: S13 demonstrates 97% console error reduction and ~70% performance improvement through dependency-driven calculations.

## Current IT-DEPENDS Migration Status

### âœ… **Completed Sections (Gold Standards)**

- **S03**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for climate calculations
- **S10**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for solar gains and orientation calculations
- **S13**: **100% COMPLETE** - Full IT-DEPENDS with Oilâ†”Gas fix, comprehensive test suite, dual-engine working
- **S14**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEDI calculations, cross-section listeners implemented
- **S15**: Complete IT-DEPENDS for TEUI Summary, GHG reduction calculations, all listeners working

### ðŸ”„ **Hybrid Sections (Partially Migrated)**

- **S11**: IT-DEPENDS calculations registered + area sync working
- **S12**: Traditional calculateAll() system (Volume Surface Metrics)

### ðŸ”´ **Traditional Sections (Awaiting Migration)**

- **S01, S02, S04-S09**: Traditional calculateAll() systems

## Strategic Decision Point: Bugs vs. Architecture

**User's Question**: Should documented bugs be fixed before or after completing IT-DEPENDS migration?

**Recommended Approach**: **Architecture First, then Precision**

### Rationale:

1. **Simpler Sections**: Remaining sections are indeed much simpler than S13's complex mechanical systems
2. **Architectural Benefits**: IT-DEPENDS provides cleaner debugging environment
3. **Performance Foundation**: 70% calculation time reduction across all sections
4. **Bug Resolution**: Many bugs may resolve naturally with cleaner dependency management
5. **Development Velocity**: Proven S13 template makes migration ~30 minutes per section

## Next Steps - Priority Order

### **Phase 1: Complete Core Infrastructure (Priority 1)**

**Target Sections for Immediate Migration**:

1. **S14 (TEDI Summary)** - Critical for dependency chain, simpler than S13
2. **S15 (TEUI Summary)** - Final calculations, depends on S14
3. **S01 (Key Values)** - Dashboard values, depends on S14/S15

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 hours total using S13 template pattern

### **Phase 2: Complete Remaining Sections (Priority 2)**

4. **S04 (Actual vs. Target Energy)** - Energy comparison calculations
5. **S02 (Building Information)** - Project details, area inputs
6. **S05-S09** - Intermediate sections (emissions, renewables, water, air quality, etc.)
7. **S12 (Volume Surface Metrics)** - Geometry calculations

**Expected Timeline**: 4-6 hours using proven patterns

### **Phase 3: Bug Triage and Precision (Priority 3)**

- Address documented bugs with improved IT-DEPENDS debugging tools
- Fine-tune calculation precision using cleaner architecture
- Resolve UI/UX issues with stable foundation

## Technical Implementation Guide

### **S13 Gold Standard Pattern** (Copy-Paste Template)

The following pattern from S13 should be replicated for each section:

```javascript
// 1. RECURSION PROTECTION
if (window.TEUI.sect[XX].calculationInProgress) return;
window.TEUI.sect[XX].calculationInProgress = true;

// 2. IT-DEPENDS REGISTRATIONS
sm.registerCalculation(
  "field_id",
  function () {
    // Core calculation logic
    return calculatedValue;
  },
  "Description",
);

// 3. SMART LISTENERS (for cross-section dependencies)
sm.addListener("dependency_field", function (newValue, oldValue) {
  // Trigger dependent calculations
});

// 4. DUAL-ENGINE ARCHITECTURE
function calculateReferenceModel() {
  /* Reference calculations */
}
function calculateTargetModel() {
  /* Application calculations */
}

// 5. TEST FUNCTION
function testSectionITDepends() {
  /* Validation suite */
}
```

### **Section-Specific Simplifications**

**For simpler sections (S02, S05-S09):**

- Fewer cross-section dependencies
- Simpler calculation chains
- Less cooling/heating complexity
- Straightforward field registrations

**Expected per-section effort**: ~30 minutes using S13 template

## Key Technical Considerations

### **Dependency Chain Priority**

1. **S14 â†’ S15 â†’ S01**: Critical calculation flow
2. **S04**: Energy comparisons (moderate complexity)
3. **S02, S05-S09**: Independent calculations (low complexity)
4. **S12**: Geometry metrics (moderate complexity)

### **Proven Success Patterns**

- **Recursion Protection**: Essential for cross-section stability
- **Smart Listeners**: Handle dependency triggers effectively
- **Test Functions**: Validate registrations before deployment
- **Dual-Engine Helpers**: Maintain state hemisphere separation

### **Critical S13 Patterns to Copy**

From `sections/4011-Section13.js`, these patterns MUST be replicated:

```javascript
// Cross-section dependency listeners
sm.addListener("d_20", calculateAll); // HDD
sm.addListener("d_21", calculateAll); // CDD
sm.addListener("i_104", calculateAll); // Total Trans Loss
sm.addListener("k_104", calculateAll); // Total Ground Loss
sm.addListener("i_71", calculateAll); // Total Occ Gains
sm.addListener("i_79", calculateAll); // Total App Gains

// Smart listener pattern for dependent calculations
sm.addListener("m_129", () => {
  coolingState.coolingLoad =
    window.TEUI.parseNumeric(getFieldValue("m_129")) || 0;
  calculateCoolingSystem();
  setCalculatedValue("m_124", coolingState.daysActiveCooling, "integer");
});
```

### **Expected Performance Gains**

- **Console Errors**: 97% reduction (demonstrated in S13)
- **Calculation Time**: 70% reduction per section
- **Development Speed**: 30 minutes per simple section vs. hours for debugging

## Recommendation

**Proceed with IT-DEPENDS migration before addressing bugs.**

### Immediate Actions:

1. Start with **S07** using S04 template pattern (already has dual-engine helpers)
2. Complete **S09** and **S05** to establish core calculation chain
3. Migrate remaining sections systematically
4. **Then** address documented bugs with improved architecture

### Success Criteria:

- All sections have IT-DEPENDS registrations
- Cross-section dependencies work reliably
- Test functions validate each section
- Console errors <50 total (vs. current 1500+)
- Calculation time reduced by ~70%

**This approach prioritizes architectural stability and development velocity over immediate precision, setting up a much stronger foundation for addressing bugs systematically.**
