📋 What's Now Documented:
🆕 Phase 13: Cross-System Data Integration (ARCHITECTURAL STRATEGY)
Complete strategic documentation covering:
🎯 Core Philosophy: Explicit user control, never automatic transfers
🔄 Professional Workflow: 3-step process from OBC → TEUI → OBC
🏗️ Technical Architecture: DataBridge pattern with field mappings
📝 6-Row CSV Format: Enhanced structure with metadata tracking
📋 Audit Console: Notes section as professional project log
🎯 Enhanced Import/Export: Cross-system options in dropdown menus
🔒 Professional Safeguards: Field-level tracking and visual indicators
💼 Benefits for Architects: Workflow efficiency and risk management
🚧 Implementation Roadmap: 5-phase development plan
🎯 Key Strategic Advantages Now Documented:

Familiar Entry Point: Architects start with required OBC Matrix
Value-Add Energy Modeling: Get TEUI head start "for free"

Professional Control: Explicit imports with preview and audit trail
Risk Management: Complete data provenance for liability protection

Seamless Iteration: Safe data flow between code compliance and energy analysis
The architecture is now fully documented and ready for development prioritization when you're ready to implement the cross-system data sharing capabilities! 🚀
This creates a solid foundation for the strategic vision of leveraging OBC Matrix as the "gateway" to energy modeling while maintaining professional standards and architect control.
